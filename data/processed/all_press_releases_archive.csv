I won Ohio twice, in a landslide, and we may have to do it again! With a heated Senate race where J.D. Vance is pulling ahead of a “RINO Democrat,” Tim Ryan, who has tied himself to me rather than Biden, yet he’s voted 100% for Biden’s destructive economic policies, little has been said about the race for Governor, where we have an outstanding person running, Mike DeWine, who quietly, but professionally and patriotically, goes about doing his job, and really well. Running alongside his very talented and loyal Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted, Ohio has been in strong hands with the Economy “roaring,” especially in the four years that I was President. This great team is running against a terrible person, and failed Mayor, Nan Whaley, where crime rates in Dayton, under her leadership, have reached new highs. I know very well who she is, and she would send Ohio back to the Stone Ages. Mike DeWine and Jon Husted truly deserve my Complete and Total Endorsement, AND THEY’VE GOT IT—they will never let you down!"

They prevented my attorneys from observing what was being taken in the raid, saying “absolutely not.” They took documents covered by attorney-client and executive privilege, which is not allowed. They took my passports.

ALL documents have been previously declassified. We are demanding the appointment of a SPECIAL MASTER to oversee the handling of the materials taken in the raid. We are further demanding that the DOJ be forced to turn over a REAL, without “plants,” inventory of my property that was taken and disclose where that property is now located. We are demanding that all items wrongfully taken from my home be IMMEDIATELY returned. The wrongful, overbroad warrant was signed by a Magistrate Judge who recused himself just two months ago, from a MAJOR civil suit that I filed, because of his bias and animus toward me. This Mar-a-Lago Break-In, Search, and Seizure was illegal and unconstitutional, and we are taking all actions necessary to get the documents back, which we would have given to them without the necessity of the despicable raid of my home, so that I can give them to the National Archives until they are required for the future Donald J.

2022-08-25,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-5pb8rhpbq60,"Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats have just orchestrated another election enhancing money grab, this time to the tune of $300,000,000,000—and just like I predicted, it’s coming right out of the pocket of the working-class Americans who are struggling the most! Crippling inflation, unaffordable energy prices, and WAR—all things that should never have happened. But if that wasn’t enough, now Americans are bailing out College Administrators who fleeced students, and those who opted for Degrees there was no way they could afford. America is a nation in decline, and the cliff into oblivion is within sight. Stop voting for Democrats! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
2022-08-24,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-m8nph26wce0,"Thank you to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) for successfully suing to release the now infamous Mueller Memo on yet another Trump prosecution. In the nine-page memo it was revealed that, “Nothing would warrant a prosecution for obstruction of justice.” It underscored that “Mueller had not found sufficient evidence to charge any underlying crime,” and that the President “reasonably believed that the Special Counsel’s investigation was interfering with his governing agenda.” The memo concluded that “the evidence was insufficient to support a criminal charge—even if Trump were not president.” It was stated that my “conduct primarily reflected a frustration with the Mueller probe and what [I] perceived to be the politics behind it,” in addition to what I believed were absolutely flawed and Fake News reports. Sound familiar? CREW is devastated by these findings, that they worked so hard to “expose,” but may now move on to the even more ridiculous Witch Hunt that has already caused a great Mar-a-Lago Red Wave with the voters of our Nation! Read the full article from Breitbart here. "

He and she will never be prosecuted, as per the last paragraphs of this story, as long as he continues to give the Radical Left the Trillions and Trillions of Dollars that they constantly DEMAND. He was afraid to use the “Debt Ceiling Card” in order to stop the most expensive waste of money in our Country’s history, to be spent on the Green New Deal, which will only cause one thing, a Depression. These expenditures are something our Country can never recover from. Mitch McConnell is not an Opposition Leader, he is a pawn for the Democrats to get whatever they want.

2022-08-08,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-gf6pdxrpau2342,"These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents. Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections. Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before. They even broke into my safe! What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee? Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States. The political persecution of President Donald J. Trump has been going on for years, with the now fully debunked Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, and so much more, it just never ends. It is political targeting at the highest level! Hillary Clinton was allowed to delete and acid wash 33,000 E-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable. She even took antique furniture, and other items from the White House. I stood up to America’s bureaucratic corruption, I restored power to the people, and truly delivered for our Country, like we have never seen before. The establishment hated it. Now, as they watch my endorsed candidates win big victories, and see my dominance in all polls, they are trying to stop me, and the Republican Party, once more. The lawlessness, political persecution, and Witch Hunt must be exposed and stopped. I will continue to fight for the Great American People!"

2022-08-02,Endorsement of Adam Steen,/news/news-ne8cqv7v3r2323,"Wisconsin’s 63rd Assembly District has a rising patriotic candidate named Adam Steen, who is running against the RINO Speaker of the Assembly, Robin Vos.  Although Vos claims to be a Republican, he is constantly fighting America First efforts and policies.  Our great slogan, Make America Great Again, is not exactly high on his list! Robin Vos supports substantially increasing Wisconsin’s gas tax, a terrible move that will seriously hurt the State’s residents.  He is also demanding the turning of Wisconsin’s public highways into toll roads as an easy, but painful, way of raising funds. As Speaker of the Assembly, Robin Vos consistently blocked efforts at conducting a full cyber forensic audit of the 2020 Election.  In fact, his appointee to study Election Fraud in Wisconsin, highly-respected Justice Michael Gableman, found massive Election-changing fraud, abuse, and irregularities.  Despite hearing this powerful evidence, Vos refused to do anything to right the wrongs that were done.  Vos let the big Supreme Court victory become just another story.  Interestingly, Justice Gableman has strongly endorsed Adam Steen.  Janel Brandtjen, the Chairwoman of the Wisconsin Assembly’s Election Committee, has also endorsed Steen, because Vos has blocked all of her efforts to secure the State’s Elections. “Rampant fraud and abuse occurred statewide,” stated Justice Gableman—yet Speaker Vos has taken no steps to hold the Wisconsin Election Commission accountable for endangering vulnerable nursing home residents in 2020.  Likewise, he has done nothing to clean up Wisconsin’s voter rolls, or remove Wisconsin from the highly controversial Election Registration Information Center (ERIC).  Vos strongly supports ballot-drop boxes, which were just declared illegal by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and tried to draft legislation to allow them, despite the outcry by his constituents.  The Democrats haven’t even bothered to put up a candidate to run against Vos because he does everything they say—he is their dream candidate—a Republican who does the job of a Democrat. Speaker Vos had 17 years to prove to Wisconsin residents that he has their best interest in mind, but even in his own campaign efforts, Vos has tried to mislead his constituents, sending out mailers that feature a picture he took with me—trying to make voters believe I am a Vos supporter, which I am not.  He does not come close to supporting America First policies, and I do not come close to supporting him. Adam Steen, on the other hand, is a motivated Patriot, dedicated to making Wisconsin Great Again.  He has had the courage to stand up strongly against “Speaker” Vos.  Adam will bravely serve the people of Wisconsin, and bring with him strength, wisdom, and a new patriotism.  Adam Steen has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

2022-07-26,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-adjun8yjjv2300,"Incredible how The New York Times just never gives up. One of their third-rate columnists wrote a story on Saturday saying that, despite almost universal victories in every major race, Trump may be losing his power. The article, written by Ross Douthat, doesn’t cover “minor” events like the fact that on Tuesday, in the Great State of Maryland, Dan Cox, a person not known but strongly Endorsed by me, absolutely destroyed the Endorsed and highly campaigned for candidate of RINO Governor Larry Hogan. This was a big upset. Fox News said it couldn’t happen! Likewise, with my Endorsement, J.D. Vance came from low in the polls to the front of the pack in Ohio. Dr Oz was also losing substantially, but went up like a rocketship once he was Endorsed by me. Ted Budd went from 3% to almost 60%, beating a former Governor by a record amount. Blake Masters in Arizona, was in third place, but because I Endorsed him, he is now leading by big numbers. Likewise, Kari Lake was one of eight candidates, and now she is, perhaps by a wide margin, in first place. In Wisconsin, I Endorsed Tim Michels, a man not well known but extremely successful, and he is now strongly leading for Governor. In Texas, I was 33-0. Every single person I Endorsed won! Likewise, for most other candidates. PERFECT in 23 States so far, UNDEFEATED in all U.S. Senate Primaries (13-0). And now others, in Missouri and Michigan, are waiting for me to Endorse, one way or another. They say, whoever I endorse will win! There are far too many races to discuss on our Truth Social platform (which in my opinion is far better than Twitter), but just like The New York Times got a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax (only to since report that the story was a FAKE, it was a made up fairytale of zero truth or consequence), their story about my possible “weakening” power is Fake News, that doesn’t mention any of these recent Victories. P.S., The Times should give up its “manufactured” Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, which was the exact opposite of the facts. They got it all wrong. The only thing they should get a Pulitzer Prize for is writing Fake News. Likewise, The Washington Post! I will say that there are disadvantages to having this never before seen Endorsement power. I endorsed Mitch McConnell, who was going to lose in a record fashion, and he ended up winning. I endorsed Brian Kemp in Georgia, who was going to come in last place, and he won in a landslide. And I Endorsed some others who have not been good to me, but I will never be good to them either. The true story is that my Endorsements have been, by any standard, amazing—stronger than ever seen before in our Country’s history. If the opposite case were true, I would be fine with strong reporting on it, but as long as it’s not, report the News correctly and accurately. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

The article, written by Ross Douthat, doesn’t cover “minor” events like the fact that on Tuesday, in the Great State of Maryland, Dan Cox, a person not known but strongly Endorsed by me, absolutely destroyed the Endorsed and highly campaigned for candidate of RINO Governor Larry Hogan. This was a big upset. Fox News said it couldn’t happen! Likewise, with my Endorsement, J.D. Vance came from low in the polls to the front of the pack in Ohio. Dr Oz was also losing substantially, but went up like a rocketship once he was Endorsed by me. Ted Budd went from 3% to almost 60%, beating a former Governor by a record amount. Blake Masters in Arizona, was in third place, but because I Endorsed him, he is now leading by big numbers. Likewise, Kari Lake was one of eight candidates, and now she is, perhaps by a wide margin, in first place. In Wisconsin, I Endorsed Tim Michels, a man not well known but extremely successful, and he is now strongly leading for Governor. In Texas, I was 33-0. Every single person I Endorsed won! Likewise, for most other candidates. PERFECT in 23 States so far, UNDEFEATED in all U.S. Senate Primaries (13-0). And now others, in Missouri and Michigan, are waiting for me to Endorse, one way or another. They say, whoever I endorse will win! There are far too many races to discuss on our Truth Social platform (which in my opinion is far better than Twitter), but just like The New York Times got a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax (only to since report that the story was a FAKE, it was a made up fairytale of zero truth or consequence), their story about my possible “weakening” power is Fake News, that doesn’t mention any of these recent Victories. P.S., The Times should give up its “manufactured” Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, which was the exact opposite of the facts. They got it all wrong. The only thing they should get a Pulitzer Prize for is writing Fake News. Likewise, The Washington Post! I will say that there are disadvantages to having this never before seen Endorsement power. I endorsed Mitch McConnell, who was going to lose in a record fashion, and he ended up winning. I endorsed Brian Kemp in Georgia, who was going to come in last place, and he won in a landslide. And I Endorsed some others who have not been good to me, but I will never be good to them either. The true story is that my Endorsements have been, by any standard, amazing—stronger than ever seen before in our Country’s history.

The article, written by Ross Douthat, doesn’t cover “minor” events like the fact that on Tuesday, in the Great State of Maryland, Dan Cox, a person not known but strongly Endorsed by me, absolutely destroyed the Endorsed and highly campaigned for candidate of RINO Governor Larry Hogan. This was a big upset. Fox News said it couldn’t happen! Likewise, with my Endorsement, J.D. Vance came from low in the polls to the front of the pack in Ohio. Dr Oz was also losing substantially, but went up like a rocketship once he was Endorsed by me. Ted Budd went from 3% to almost 60%, beating a former Governor by a record amount. Blake Masters in Arizona, was in third place, but because I Endorsed him, he is now leading by big numbers. Likewise, Kari Lake was one of eight candidates, and now she is, perhaps by a wide margin, in first place. In Wisconsin, I Endorsed Tim Michels, a man not well known but extremely successful, and he is now strongly leading for Governor. In Texas, I was 33-0. Every single person I Endorsed won! Likewise, for most other candidates. PERFECT in 23 States so far, UNDEFEATED in all U.S. Senate Primaries (13-0). And now others, in Missouri and Michigan, are waiting for me to Endorse, one way or another. They say, whoever I endorse will win! There are far too many races to discuss on our Truth Social platform (which in my opinion is far better than Twitter), but just like The New York Times got a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax (only to since report that the story was a FAKE, it was a made up fairytale of zero truth or consequence), their story about my possible “weakening” power is Fake News, that doesn’t mention any of these recent Victories. P.S., The Times should give up its “manufactured” Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, which was the exact opposite of the facts. They got it all wrong. The only thing they should get a Pulitzer Prize for is writing Fake News. Likewise, The Washington Post! I will say that there are disadvantages to having this never before seen Endorsement power. I endorsed Mitch McConnell, who was going to lose in a record fashion, and he ended up winning. I endorsed Brian Kemp in Georgia, who was going to come in last place, and he won in a landslide. And I Endorsed some others who have not been good to me, but I will never be good to them either. The true story is that my Endorsements have been, by any standard, amazing—stronger than ever seen before in our Country’s history.

Instead of acting with integrity and providing transparency, the Pulitzer Board is running cover for the biggest reporting failure in modern history: the fake Russia Russia Russia collusion hoax.Why would The Washington Post or The New York Times ever want to admit their obvious mistakes and come clean when their false reporting is being guarded, and awarded, by the Pulitzer Prize, which at one point actually meant something?These outlets should hand back their prizes without notification from Pulitzer, which would be the honorable thing to do.The only way The New York Times and The Washington Post should get a possible Pulitzer Prize would be in a new category—disinformation, for helping to perpetrate a false story created and peddled by Crooked Hillary Clinton, the DNC, and certain lowlife Democrats.The truth is that the 2018 Pulitzer Prize was handed out for reporting that merely parroted political disinformation—disinformation that we know was fabricated by foreign operatives and my political opponents.If the Pulitzer Prize has become a blatant acknowledgement of false, liberal political propaganda, then the Pulitzer Board should just say so.Instead, they hide their supposed “independent investigations” in a veil of secrecy, so the public cannot know the truth.I will continue doing everything possible to right the wrong caused by the 2018 Pulitzer Prize and also to right the wrong being done by the January 6 Committee of Unselects, where there is no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, no real Republican members, and no legitimacy.

He has spent decades protecting the citizens of Arizona, and now wants to protect them in the State Legislature from the out of control Radical Left Democrats, and the almost as bad RINOs, who are standing by while they watch our Country being destroyed. MAGA Strong Rob Scantlebury won’t let that happen, and is running to protect Life, our First Amendment, Religious Liberty, our 2nd Amendment (which is under siege), to secure our Border, and to bring Great Education back to Arizona. His opponent, Tyler Pace, is a RINO like Jeff “Flakey” Flake (if that’s even possible!), who never had a clue. Robert “gets it,” and will always put America First.

Her opponent, Joanne Osborne, is a RINO disaster, who is being pushed by pathetic Arizona governor, Doug Ducey, who has allowed so many bad things to happen to the State, like Weak Borders and bad Election Integrity. Even the sad clown, Jeff “Flakey” Flake, is on her side, and that’s all you have to know. Early Voting starts today, and Election Day is August 2nd.

Bowers fought Election Integrity harder than any Democrat, or even the RINO Commissioners of Maricopa County. In fact, the RINOs of the State, headed by Bowers and his group, were far worse than the Democrats because you never knew where they were coming from.

David Farnsworth will get rid of the stench of Rusty Bowers and his crew of RINOs who are systematically destroying everything that Arizona stands for.

Bowers fought Election Integrity harder than any Democrat, or even the RINO Commissioners of Maricopa County. In fact, the RINOs of the State, headed by Bowers and his group, were far worse than the Democrats because you never knew where they were coming from. Bowers must be defeated, and highly respected David Farnsworth is the man to do it. He will straighten things out and secure your Border (just as we had, when I was President, the most secure Southern Border in the history of our Country, only two short years ago!). This is a very important race because it will determine the future of Arizona, which is now on the precipice of disaster, with illegal aliens pouring in at every level and voters, through massive voter fraud and irregularities, losing their VOICE. David Farnsworth will get rid of the stench of Rusty Bowers and his crew of RINOs who are systematically destroying everything that Arizona stands for. He is a puppet of Governor Doug Ducey, a man who was totally afraid to act on so many important issues. It is my great honor to state that former State Senator David Farnsworth has my Complete and Total Endorsement for State Senate in Arizona Legislative District 10!"

2022-06-24,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-5jzq6vjjmd0,"Today’s decision, which is the biggest WIN for LIFE in a generation, along with other decisions that have been announced recently, were only made possible because I delivered everything as promised, including nominating and getting three highly respected and strong Constitutionalists confirmed to the United States Supreme Court. It was my great honor to do so! I did not cave to the Radical Left Democrats, their partners in the Fake News Media, or the RINOs who are likewise the true, but silent, enemy of the people. These major Victories prove that even though the Radical Left is doing everything in their power to destroy our Country, your Rights are being protected, the Country is being defended, and there is still hope and time to Save America! I will never stop fighting for the Great People of our Nation!"

Gas prices have reached an all-time high. Ships are unable to unload cargo. Families cannot get needed baby formula. We are an embarrassment around the world. Our withdrawal from Afghanistan was a disaster that cost us precious American blood, and gave $85 billion worth of the best military equipment on earth to our enemy. Millions and millions of illegals are marching to the border and invading our country. We have a White House in shambles, with Democrats, just this week, declaring that Biden is unfit to run for reelection. And what is the Democrat Congress focused on? A Kangaroo Court, hoping to distract the American people from the great pain they are experiencing.  Seventeen months after the events of January 6th, Democrats are unable to offer solutions. They are desperate to change the narrative of a failing nation, without even making mention of the havoc and death caused by the Radical Left just months earlier. Make no mistake, they control the government. They own this disaster. They are hoping that these hearings will somehow alter their failing prospects. A certain Democrat once said, “It's the economy, stupid.” Well, Democrats now seem to think that Americans are “stupid.” They are not. America is crumbling, and Democrats have no solutions. Our nation has no hope of change for the better under Democrat leadership. People are desperate. Rather than solving problems, Democrats are rehashing history in hopes of changing the narrative. During my time in office, our nation was thriving, our economy was strong, and the price of gas was very low. Above all else, we were respected, perhaps like never before.  America prospered under the Trump Administration.   Continue reading here.  "

2022-06-10,Endorsement of Katie Britt,/news/news-hgbj9bay6y2129,"Last year I endorsed Mo Brooks for the U.S. Senate because I thought he was a Fighter, especially when it came to the Rigged and Stolen Presidential Election of 2020.  The evidence is irrefutable.  Then, out of nowhere, and for seemingly no reason, Mo backtracked and made a big mistake by going Woke at our massive Cullman, Alabama Rally.  Instead of denouncing the Voter Fraud in the Election, Mo lectured the crowd of 63,000 people saying, “Put that behind you, put that behind you,” meaning that, in effect, forget the Rigged Election and go on to the future.  The problem is, if you do that, it will happen again.  Also, why do Republicans allow Democrats to get away with rigging and stealing elections?  Mo was strongly booed by tens of thousands of Great Alabama Patriots for abandoning his constituents, and what they know to be true about the Election Fraud.  He foolishly started listening to the wrong consultants and not to the people, and his 54-point lead evaporated overnight.  Likewise, his words caused me to withdraw my Endorsement, and Mo has been wanting it back ever since—but I cannot give it to him! Katie Britt, on the other hand, is a fearless America First Warrior.  The opposition says Katie is close to Mitch McConnell, but actually, she is not—in fact, she believes that McConnell put Mike Durant in the race to stop her, which is very possibly true.  Katie is an Incredible Fighter for the people of Alabama.  As President and CEO of Alabama’s Business Council, Katie has been working hard to Grow Alabama’s Economy, Create Jobs, and Restore the Great American Dream.  She has the Total Support and Endorsement of Chairman Jimmy Parnell and the Alabama Farmers Federation. The proud mother of two wonderful children, Katie, along with her great husband, Wesley, a Star at the University of Alabama and the New England Patriots, are True Champions for the American Family.  Katie Strongly Supports our under siege Second Amendment, Stands Up for Parental Rights, and Will Fight for our Military, our Vets, and Election Integrity. Above all, Katie Britt will never let you down.  So Get Out and Vote for Katie Britt on June 21st in the Alabama Senate Runoff—she has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

2022-06-10,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-wkp3j2majn2133,"Last week, on June 1, a three-judge panel of the Georgia Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in a vital case involving the public’s right to know the truth about the makeup of 148,000 absentee ballots, many of which were harvested and dumped into drop boxes in the dark of night in the period leading up to the November 3, 2020 election in Fulton County, Georgia. This case is being closely watched by millions of Georgia voters and American patriots all across the country who are demanding transparency! Petitioners who filed the case are Caroline Jeffords and Robbin Sotir, registered voters who argue that their votes were diminished and diluted, and who are supported by affidavits of eyewitnesses who observed that many absentee ballots were never folded (which is required in order to be mailed inside an envelope!), that other ballots were filled out with a printer rather than by a person using a pen (which is obviously corrupt and illegal), along with other disqualifying “irregularities.” Greatly respected Georgia attorney Bob Cheeley and his law firm are fighting on the side of the Petitioners and our Democracy, itself. The appeals court panel of Presiding Judge Christopher J. McFadden, Judge Elizabeth Gobeil and Judge Andrew A. Pinson, were asked by Mr. Cheeley to reverse the trial court which, after originally granting the Petitioners’ motion to unseal the ballots and permit an inspection of the absentee ballots and the envelopes, stated that there needs to be a one-to-one ratio of envelopes to ballots. Cheeley urged the appeals court to recognize that the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held, as far back as 1942, that if a citizen alleges that there is evidence of vote dilution due to “ballot stuffing,” then a “particularized injury” has been established and the courts have routinely allowed an inspection. He also made the key points that Georgia law allows a Superior Court judge to unseal ballots for inspection and that ballots are not protected under the state’s Open Records Act. Therefore, it is crystal clear that citizens of Georgia should be permitted to see the ballots and the envelopes that those ballots should have been inserted into prior to mailing or being placed into a drop box. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies should be very interested in the Jeffords/Sotir case, because the Federalist Society is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.  I join with millions of Georgians and implore these fine jurists to reverse the trial court and send the case back to the lower court which previously determined that Petitioners, through expert testimony, had established a strong case justifying the unsealing of Fulton’s absentee ballots from the November 2020 elections. Why don’t they want to show the ballots and the envelopes? What are they hiding? The very foundation of our Country is at stake and the people of Georgia, and our Nation, deserve to know the truth about who won the 2020 election!"

He also made the key points that Georgia law allows a Superior Court judge to unseal ballots for inspection and that ballots are not protected under the state’s Open Records Act. Therefore, it is crystal clear that citizens of Georgia should be permitted to see the ballots and the envelopes that those ballots should have been inserted into prior to mailing or being placed into a drop box. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies should be very interested in the Jeffords/Sotir case, because the Federalist Society is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.  I join with millions of Georgians and implore these fine jurists to reverse the trial court and send the case back to the lower court which previously determined that Petitioners, through expert testimony, had established a strong case justifying the unsealing of Fulton’s absentee ballots from the November 2020 elections. Why don’t they want to show the ballots and the envelopes? What are they hiding? The very foundation of our Country is at stake and the people of Georgia, and our Nation, deserve to know the truth about who won the 2020 election!"

2022-06-10,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-samtuzdgsw0,"Last week, on June 1, a three-judge panel of the Georgia Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in a vital case involving the public’s right to know the truth about the makeup of 148,000 absentee ballots, many of which were harvested and dumped into drop boxes in the dark of night in the period leading up to the November 3, 2020 election in Fulton County, Georgia. This case is being closely watched by millions of Georgia voters and American patriots all across the country who are demanding transparency! Petitioners who filed the case are Caroline Jeffords and Robbin Sotir, registered voters who argue that their votes were diminished and diluted, and who are supported by affidavits of eyewitnesses who observed that many absentee ballots were never folded (which is required in order to be mailed inside an envelope!), that other ballots were filled out with a printer rather than by a person using a pen (which is obviously corrupt and illegal), along with other disqualifying “irregularities.” Greatly respected Georgia attorney Bob Cheeley and his law firm are fighting on the side of the Petitioners and our Democracy, itself. The appeals court panel of Presiding Judge Christopher J. McFadden, Judge Elizabeth Gobeil and Judge Andrew A. Pinson, were asked by Mr. Cheeley to reverse the trial court which, after originally granting the Petitioners’ motion to unseal the ballots and permit an inspection of the absentee ballots and the envelopes, stated that there needs to be a one-to-one ratio of envelopes to ballots. Cheeley urged the appeals court to recognize that the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held, as far back as 1942, that if a citizen alleges that there is evidence of vote dilution due to “ballot stuffing,” then a “particularized injury” has been established and the courts have routinely allowed an inspection.

In addition, he runs a nonprofit foundation that promotes science and innovation.  In other words, he is a great modern-day thinker!  A graduate of Stanford University and Stanford University Law School, a fantastic student, Blake is also the author of The New York Times bestseller, “Zero to One.” Despite having such an amazing business career and wonderful family, Blake has decided that he wants to make a difference for the people of our Country, and is therefore running for the United States Senate from the Great State of Arizona. Blake is Strong on Border Security, in particular, the disastrous Southern Border where people are pouring into the U.S. by the millions, and destroying our Country.  Just two years ago, with the help of the Wall, we had the Strongest Border in the history of our Country, and now we have the weakest—Blake will turn that around quickly. Additionally, he will Cut Taxes and Regulations, be Tough on Crime, and Support our Military and our Vets.  Blake will fight for our totally under-siege Second Amendment, and WIN! Mark Brnovich is such a disappointment to me.  He is the current Arizona Attorney General, and while he understands what took place in the 2020 Presidential Election, and that it was Rigged and Stolen, he only views it as something he would like not to see happen again.  The Arizona State Senate gave him overwhelming evidence of fraud and irregularities, issued a report which was damning, and he did nothing about it.  In other words, all talk and no action!  As an example, hundreds of “mules” trafficked ballots in the 2020 Election in Arizona, and Brnovich has refused to hold them accountable.  The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors refused to comply with a lawful Arizona Senate subpoena, and Brnovich failed to use his authority to compel the County to turn the information over.  He didn’t want to make “waves.” Brnovich, therefore, does not support clean and fair elections, or law and order, and could not properly represent the people of Arizona in the United States Senate. Arizona is a State where the 2020 Election was Rigged and Stolen, and a very thorough audit proved it.  Blake knows that the “Crime of the Century” took place, he will expose it and also, never let it happen again. It is my great honor to give Blake Masters my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

To ignore the fraud that Justice Gableman continues to uncover is to allow that fraud to be repeated. Justice Gableman’s Report revealed many illegal and unethical acts including Zuckerberg funded election bribery, illegal ballot drop boxes, and obstruction of evidence gathering. Gableman also revealed that the Wisconsin Election Commission shared access to Wisconsin’s registration system with Zuckerberg funded left-wing activists, disregarded Wisconsin law so that tens of thousands of nursing home residents could be exploited for their votes, and illegally encouraged Wisconsin voters declare themselves “indefinitely confined” under Wisconsin law, thereby avoiding Wisconsin’s voter ID requirements. These issues are far from “ghosts” as the editorial board claims.

2022-05-01,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-q4aj3agpfe1967,"The New York Times said today, in a major article, “Segments featuring Fox’s own reporters consistently drew lower ratings, especially if they were covering stories the audience deemed unfavorable to Mr. Trump.” The primary thing they don’t want to talk about is the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election. It’s all about that from the Laptop from Hell, to the ballot harvesting scandal, to the Zuckerberg Facebook Unlocked boxes, to cancellation by Big Tech. It’s all having to do with the Election, the most important thing they have ever done, because that’s the one subject they just don’t want to talk about. It was too corrupt, it’s now been proven, and they just want to skate by—they just want this subject to end. Mitch McConnell and his RINO friends would rather see a Democrat like Biden be president than a Republican like me. It works better for him and his agenda, but it doesn’t work better for our Country. He should have done something about it, and he still should. When a thief robs a jewelry store and gets caught, they have to give back the jewelry. Think of it: The election was rigged and stolen, we found out how, and Republican leadership doesn’t want to do anything about it. They say, “Sir, you’re winning in a landslide, both against Republicans and Democrats. Think to the future, sir. Think to the future.” To which I say, “You can never think to the future until we solve the past, because it will just happen again.” Everybody go out and study True the Vote and all of the information about illegal ballot harvesting, millions of votes, that’s coming out next week. Also, check out the Dinesh D’Souza documentary, “2000 Mules,” about this scam. You will come away a different person, and say to yourself that our Country’s elections are run worse than those of a third world nation."

2022-05-01,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-qcx9zxw7xr1967,"The New York Times said today, in a major article, “Segments featuring Fox’s own reporters consistently drew lower ratings, especially if they were covering stories the audience deemed unfavorable to Mr. Trump.” The primary thing they don’t want to talk about is the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election. It’s all about that from the Laptop from Hell, to the ballot harvesting scandal, to the Zuckerberg Facebook Unlocked boxes, to cancellation by Big Tech. It’s all having to do with the Election, the most important thing they have ever done, because that’s the one subject they just don’t want to talk about. It was too corrupt, it’s now been proven, and they just want to skate by—they just want this subject to end. Mitch McConnell and his RINO friends would rather see a Democrat like Biden be president than a Republican like me. It works better for him and his agenda, but it doesn’t work better for our Country. He should have done something about it, and he still should. When a thief robs a jewelry store and gets caught, they have to give back the jewelry. Think of it: The election was rigged and stolen, we found out how, and Republican leadership doesn’t want to do anything about it. They say, “Sir, you’re winning in a landslide, both against Republicans and Democrats. Think to the future, sir. Think to the future.” To which I say, “You can never think to the future until we solve the past, because it will just happen again.” Everybody go out and study True the Vote and all of the information about illegal ballot harvesting, millions of votes, that’s coming out next week. Also, check out the Dinesh D’Souza documentary, “2000 Mules,” about this scam. You will come away a different person, and say to yourself that our Country’s elections are run worse than those of a third world nation."

It also showed how important it is for the MAGA voters to go and support David Perdue in the Election. It is not easy to beat an incumbent, however, if our voters turn out, David Perdue will win in a landslide. A lot is on the line, including record-setting CRIME, which Brian Kemp has done nothing about, letting great communities like Buckhead be overrun by theft, murders, shootings, and drug deals. David Perdue will fight for Georgia, and he is the only Republican who can beat Stacey “The Hoax” Abrams, because MAGA voters will not come out to vote for Kemp. Very sadly, a Kemp win will negatively affect the great Herschel Walker’s race for the Senate—it will be very hard for him to win with Kemp on the ticket.

She is now going through hell in their attempt to unseat her, just more of an election mess in Georgia, including the fact that they will still allow easily corruptible Ballot Boxes for all to cheat with, and have not been able to get a little thing called “Signature Verification” approved. Unlike other Republicans, this Governor does everything possible to hurt the voting process in Georgia, including his approval of a disastrous Consent Decree, and not calling a Special Session that was requested by Georgia’s Republicans Senators. He absolutely refused. Both of those failures were a disaster for the Republican Party, and for our Country. Even the “True the Vote” people, great patriots, who will soon announce massive Ballot Harvesting in Georgia and other States, said Kemp was the worst of all Governors to deal with—he didn’t want to do anything to help with finding this massive Ballot Harvesting fraud. Brian Kemp should be voted out of office—vote for David Perdue. REMEMBER, Brian Kemp will never be able to win the General Election against Stacey “The Hoax” Abrams because a large number of Republicans just will not vote for him."

Piers got caught red-handed, and the interview that I rather enjoyed doing is now in shambles. I especially enjoyed talking about the 2020 Presidential Election Fraud and his big mistake on the way he walked off his show when the “weatherman” made him look like a fool. I never walked out of my interviews with him, he’s easy, but he tried to make it look like I did. Unlike others, I don’t believe Piers is a complete slimeball, but he lost a lot of credibility. Interestingly, many of the Fake News Media outlets are covering his mistake. They view it as potentially fraudulent, and so do I.

The evidence is massive and irrefutable (check out Truth the Vote and the Dinesh D'Souza documentary, which will all be coming out soon). For those who want to make Piers look bad, compare his video promo and how it was doctored to the real thing. Hopefully they will now be doing some big changes to their final product.

Many people said that he would do nothing about it because that just seems to be the way he is. I felt differently because the numbers and sheer amount of crime committed is so compelling, irrefutable, and determinative—the election result would have been entirely different. Well, he did a report, and he recites some of the many horrible things that happened in that very dark period of American history but, rather than go after the people that committed these election crimes, it looks like he is just going to “kick the can down the road” and stay in that middle path of non-controversy. He wants to be politically correct. Because of the amount of time that it took him to do the report, which was endless, his poll numbers have been rapidly sinking. Now, people are upset with the fact that while he states the problem, he seems to be doing nothing about it—he doesn’t give the answers. What a shame for the Great State of Arizona, and for our Country itself! Because of this election, the USA is “going to hell” with Inflation, Russia attacking Ukraine, the loss of Energy Independence, 5-dollar gasoline, a wide-open Border and, of course, the incompetence with which our pull-out from Afghanistan was handled. With an honest election, none of these things would have been a problem, they were all self-inflicted wounds. The good news is Arizona has some very good people running for election to the U.S. Senate. I will be making an Endorsement in the not too distant future!"

VANCE FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN OHIO,/news/news-w3bcbxwaju1882,"MAGA patriots from across the nation are set to deliver an election landside for Republicans that will serve as a devastating rebuke of the failures of Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats. In the Great State of Ohio, the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November is J.D. Vance. We cannot play games. It is all about winning! Like some others, J.D. Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades. He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race. The Democrats will be spending many millions of dollars, but the good news is that they have a defective candidate who ran for President and garnered exactly zero percent in the polls. The bottom line is, we must have a Republican victory in Ohio.   This is not an easy endorsement for me to make because I like and respect some of the other candidates in the race—they’ve said great things about “Trump” and, like me, they love Ohio and love our Country. I’ve studied this race closely and I think J.D. is the most likely to take out the weak, but dangerous, Democrat opponent—dangerous because they will have so much money to spend. However, J.D. will destroy him in the debates and will fight for the MAGA Movement in the Senate. He’s strong on the Border, tough on Crime, understands how to use Taxes and Tariffs to hold China accountable, will fight to break up Big Tech, and has been a warrior on the Rigged and Stolen Presidential Election. J.D. is a Marine who served in the Iraq War, a graduate of The Ohio State University, and earned a Law Degree from Yale—a great student. With J.D. Vance, Ohio gets both brains and brawn. Ohio has been good to me, I won it twice, really BIG, and I have likewise been GREAT for Ohio. Let’s keep it going! It is time for the entire MAGA movement, the greatest in the history of our Country, to unite behind J.D.’s campaign because, unlike so many other pretenders and wannabes, he will put America First. In other words, J.D. Vance has my Complete and Total Endorsement. He will not let you down. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

2022-04-08,Statement by President Donald J. Trump on Prosecutorial Misconduct in New York,/news/news-76aww2em5c1847,"What the Fake News Media doesn’t tell you, and they are doing everything within their power to force prosecutors throughout the Country to do a terrible injustice to our Nation and its people, is that a low-life attorney named Mark Pomerantz, who is a “Never Trumper” and a Hillary Clinton sycophant (together with his wife), left a Never Trumper, Crooked Hillary law firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, with two young associates who were also Never Trumpers, in order to go into the District Attorney’s office to unjustly prosecute a man named Donald J. Trump, who also just happens to be the 45th President of the United States, and is leading in every poll to be the 47th. The Fake News also didn’t reveal the fact that this is virtually unprecedented for private lawyers to take an unpaid leave of absence from an opposing party law firm in order to prosecute anyone, let alone a former President. They also didn’t tell you that a principal leader of the firm is Robert Schumer, the brother of Chuck Schumer, that the firm is a Never Trumper firm and works for the Democrat Party, that for lawyers to go into the New York City’s District Attorney’s office to prosecute an opponent is unprecedented in NYC history because the District Attorney’s office has hundreds of lawyers already working there, and that a number of Assistant District Attorneys refused to work on the case because they felt I was being treated extremely unfairly, and that indeed, there was no case.Can you imagine a Never Trumper Democrat-only law firm sending a Never Trumper law partner with two associates to the District Attorney’s office to prosecute their political opponent, Donald J. Trump, and the firm represents the Democrat Party, and is headed by Robert Schumer, Chuck Schumer's brother, and many other Never Trumpers? What kind of Country are we living in?"
2022-04-07,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-jh8xwsvmqp1842,"This is just a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt of all time, by a failed Attorney General, who continues to use her office for political gain following a disastrous and embarrassing attempt to run for Governor, in which she only received a 3% approval rating, and was forced to drop out of the race by her own party, in disgrace. This Democrat prosecutorial misconduct began the second I came down the escalator in Trump Tower, and has continued in an attempt to silence a President who is leading in every single poll. Never before has this happened to another President, and it is an absolute violation of my civil rights. As President I had two jobs—to run our Country well, and to survive. I've been investigated by the Democrats more than Billy the Kid, Jesse James, and Al Capone, combined. This has been going on for years, and in all cases, I have been innocent. After having survived so many investigations, numerous people have said to me, “You must be the cleanest person alive. Nobody else could have survived this.” But how do I get my reputation back as this unfair persecution endlessly continues? Letitia James is no longer working as Attorney General, she is an operative for the Democrat Party in a political prosecution. New York has been through hell, and she is an embarrassment to our legal system. James uses her office for political gain, while New York crime is up over 50 percent, a bigger increase than any other place in the Nation. Much of it is violent crime—murder, rape, and drug trafficking (which is at the highest level ever).  When will the Witch Hunt against a popular former President, who had our Country Energy Independent, with no Inflation, a strong Southern Border, and no Wars (such as that which is now raging uncontrollably in Ukraine), who rebuilt our Military (including Space Force), cut Taxes, Regulations, and so much more, ever end. When will horrible and unfair political harassment and persecution in our Country finally be over. Instead, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

It’s troubling how politicized our justice system has become, where Democrats are loaned out to gin up crimes against their political opponents. President Trump built a great business, and did nothing wrong. New York should get back to solving their skyrocketing crime problem, rather than spending so much time and energy on partisan witch hunts.""On top of everything else, their firm represents the DNC, Democrats, and is Hillary Clinton’s law firm. This is disgraceful behavior and how somebody like that and others from his firm can be let loose to become prosecutors of a great Republican President is disgraceful. So bad, in fact, that professional prosecutors resigned in protest of this presidential persecution. They thought it was very unfair.

If we forget, the Radical Left Democrats will continue to Cheat and Steal Elections. Just look at what is happening in Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and elsewhere, but tremendous progress has been made that will help us in 2022 and 2024. The 2020 Election was rigged, and we can’t let them get away with it. When I endorsed Mo Brooks, he took a 44-point lead and was unstoppable. He then hired a new campaign staff who “brilliantly” convinced him to ""stop talking about the 2020 Election.” He listened to them. Then, according to the polls, Mo’s 44-point lead totally evaporated all based on his “2020” statement made at our massive rally in Cullman, Alabama. When I heard his statement, I said, “Mo, you just blew the Election, and there’s nothing you can do about it.” Very sad but, since he decided to go in another direction, so have I, and I am hereby withdrawing my Endorsement of Mo Brooks for the Senate. I don’t think the great people of Alabama will disagree with me. Election Fraud must be captured and stopped, or we won’t have a Country anymore.

He spent more time hunting those people who fought for the truth than he did those who cheated in the Election. Chris Carr was a disaster every step of the way. He wasn’t looking for Election Integrity, but rather, an easy way out. John Gordon, on the other hand, will get to the bottom of it all. He is tough, strong, smart, and loves the people of Georgia. He is also strong on the Border, Crime, our Military, Vets, and will proudly protect our Second Amendment. He will be a spectacular Attorney General, something the state so desperately needs.

There is already a very powerful resolution in the Wisconsin State Assembly that calls for the decertification of the 2020 Election and reclaiming of Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes. There is so much fraud, as Vos knows, that this should be done quickly and easily. The highly respected Special Counsel, Michael Gableman, has exposed so much already, including election bribery with Mark Zuckerberg’s $8.8 million, horrific fraud stealing votes from the elderly in nursing homes, and rampant ballot harvesting and phantom votes. Far more votes than is needed for the Republican candidate, me, to win. Our Country would not be in the mess it’s in if Republicans had the courage to act. We would be energy independent, no inflation, the Ukraine desecration would not be happening, our economy would be strong, there would have been no surrender in Afghanistan, and so much else.

As governor, David will restore integrity to our elections, he will eliminate the Georgia Income Tax, and he will put PARENTS back in charge of Georgia schools. David truly loves his state and his country, and he has my Complete and Total Endorsement. David is running against Brian Kemp, a horrendous RINO who has betrayed the people of Georgia, and betrayed Republican voters. As governor, Brian Kemp has repeatedly surrendered to Stacey Abrams and the Radical Left: ·      Kemp allowed himself to be bullied into a disastrous consent decree that effectively abolished signature verification and allowed massive voter fraud to occur throughout the state of Georgia. ·      True the Vote released bombshell evidence revealing a gigantic illegal ballot harvesting scheme—involving more than 2,000 ballot traffickers—that took place on Kemp’s watch, and he does not even care. ·      Under Kemp, Georgia officials took $45 million dollars from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg to fund election-related activities—over 90 percent of which was given to blue areas of the state to bolster Democrat turnout. ·      He allowed a left-wing organization to mail out 2.2 million absentee ballot applications and place unsecured drop boxes throughout the state. A vote for RINO Brian Kemp in this primary is a vote for Governor Stacey Abrams. A vote for David Perdue is a vote to save Georgia from the Radical Left! Together, we will FIRE Brian Kemp, we will RESTORE Election Integrity in Georgia, and we will Make America Great Again!"

In Russia, the people are not allowed to know that they’re fighting a war with Ukraine, that’s where our media is going, and that’s where our Country is going because it quickly follows—just study history.

I feel confident that Robin will exercise his moral duty to follow up on Justice Gableman’s findings. In addition to announcing that they will stay in session and take action to get rid of ERIC and the WEC, which have done some very bad things and made review very difficult (as also noted by the Legislative Audit Bureau), based on the Gableman report, I would imagine that there can only be a Decertification of Electors. This is one of the biggest stories of our generation, even though the Fake News Media will try to play it down as much as they can.   Also, this past October the Racine County Sheriff, Christopher Schmaling, referred felony criminal charges against five of the six members of the Wisconsin Election Commission (“WEC”) for their scheme to violate Wisconsin law and allow illegal vote harvesting in nursing homes. The Sheriff stated that the governing “election statute was in fact not just broken but shattered” in all 72 counties across Wisconsin.

Few things could be more fraudulent, or met with more irregularities, than the Presidential Election of 2020. They refuse to cover the facts, such as just this week the special counsel in Wisconsin called for the decertification of the 2020 Election because of massive illegality, including election bribery, and the preying on the elderly for votes, which resulted in fraud of “95-100 percent turnout,” an impossibility, in at least 91 nursing homes. This is true with many other states, especially swing states. In Arizona, 204,430 mail-in ballots had mismatched signatures that were never sent to review, and 740,000 mail-in ballots had broken chain of custody, all far more necessary than the votes needed, 10,457, for “President Trump to win.” In Georgia, over 240 ballot harvesters have been identified in an illegal operation spanning multiple swing states, all caught on video. The evidence is monumental but the Unselect Committee of politically partisan hacks, and someone who had a steaming hot affair with a Chinese spy, hides the facts. Judges and even justices of the United States Supreme Court, are afraid to even look, as was the Attorney General of the United States, who was so petrified of being held in contempt or being impeached by the Democrats, which they were constantly threatening him with, that he was virtually a broken man who allowed for the systemic violation of election laws and other things to take place. The reason for January 6th was that millions of people in our Country know the Election was Rigged and Stolen, and Nancy Pelosi refused to put the requested 10,000+ troops in the Capitol three days earlier, as strongly recommended by me. She didn’t like “the look.” The Unselect Committee’s sole goal is to try to prevent President Trump, who is leading by large margins in every poll, from running again for president, if I so choose. By so doing they are destroying democracy as we know it. Their lies and Marxist tactics against political opponents will not stop the truth, or the biggest political movement, Make America Great Again/America First, in the history of our Country.

2022-03-02,Texas Election Update from Dan Patrick,/news/news-chbfstzwkq1667,"Mr. President,I’m proud to tell you that every candidate I asked you to endorse won or is solidly in first place going into a run-off. You were 12-0 last night with your Texas endorsements last night from my list of recommendations.Your key endorsement of strong conservative candidates, who believe in the MAGA policies, who worked hard every day for months, was a winning combination over their opponents.Here are some highlights:1. Your endorsement, along with the most conservative session in history last year, helped me receive more votes than any person on the ballot. I ended with over 1.4 million votes. That is 300,00 votes higher than my 2018 primary and it appears to be an all time record for any candidate ever in a Texas contested primary. I used your endorsement in all of our ads, mailers & was pinned to the top of my Facebook page for months.2. Ryan Guillen won last night with 54% of the vote in a 3 way race. He is the bold Democrat that changed parties in the border region. That is something you should be very proud of. That was an historic win that will open the door for more conservative Hispanic Democrats to switch parties. 3. Ken Paxton finished first in a tough 4 way race. He is in a solid first place position going into the run-off.4. You scored a big conservative win in Tarrant County for County Judge. Tim O'Hare won with nearly 57% over longtime Fort Worth Mayor who was the early favorite.Winners outright last night:Kevin Sparks, the oilman in West Texas, won in a 4 way race with nearly 54% of the vote. Mayes Middleton won in a 4 way race with 56% of the vote.Governor Abbott won with 66% in an 8 way race.I won with 76% of the vote in a 6 way race and as noted had highest vote total of any candidate.Glen Hegar won easily in a 2 way race. Angela Paxton won 65% in a 2 way race.And as noted myself, Tim O'Hare and Ryan Guillen all won in multi-candidate races.Run-Offs Scheduled for May 24th:1. Ken Paxton 42% , George P. Bush 22%2. Senator Pete Flores 46% in a 3 way race. He is the 1st Hispanic Republican to be elected to the Texas Senate in history. 3. Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham 42% in an 8 way race. Her second place opponent is at 17%.4. Tarrant DA Philip Sorrells 41% finished first in a 3 way race.5. House candidate Frederick Frazier finished first with 44% in a 3 way race. What’s also important to remember is that with a few exceptions when you endorsed early on, there were no guarantees. These were hard fought races.I recommended them because I believed in them and I knew your endorsement along with their work ethic and conservative records would get them into the winners circle. They all thank you for your strong total and complete endorsement as I do.I know you also had other big wins in Texas last night as well.No President’s endorsement in history has ever been as powerful as yours.Dan Patrick"

This in itself is a scandal, the fact that a story so big, so powerful, and so important for the future of our Nation is getting zero coverage from LameStream, is being talked about all over the world. Just like they wouldn’t talk about the many Biden corruption scandals prior to the Election, (or for that matter now!), they won’t talk about this, which is potentially even bigger. It shows how totally corrupt and shameless the media is. Can you imagine if the roles were reversed and the Republicans, in particular President Donald Trump, got caught illegally spying into the Office of the President? All hell would break loose and the electric chair would immediately come out of retirement.

A hearing this week revealed at least 50,000 illegal phantom votes were cast in the 2020 Presidential Election, which is more than twice the “victory” margin. Incredible problems were also uncovered within Wisconsin’s voter rolls, including an apartment building with 102 percent turnout rate (not possible), 113 ballots cast from an address where no one lives, 3,713 “voters” registered to U.S. Post Offices, and 625,000 dead people on Wisconsin’s voter rolls. In addition, 46,000 votes were cast on Nov. 3rd based on voter information that was never verified by the state. This is on top of massive ballot harvesting, rigged “indefinitely confined” votes, the Wisconsin Election Commission instructing election officials to break the law, Zuckerberg drop boxes, etc. So who in Wisconsin is leading the charge to decertify this fraudulent Election?

Some of this information will someday be displayed in the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library for the public to view my Administration’s incredible accomplishments for the American People.  The media’s characterization of my relationship with NARA is Fake News. It was exactly the opposite! It was a great honor to work with NARA to help formally preserve the Trump Legacy. The papers were given easily and without conflict and on a very friendly basis, which is different from the accounts being drawn up by the Fake News Media. In fact, it was viewed as routine and ""no big deal."" In actuality, I have been told I was under no obligation to give this material based on various legal rulings that have been made over the years. Crooked Hillary Clinton, as an example, deleted and acid washed 32,000 emails and never gave that to the government. Then, they took large amounts of furniture out of the White House. And Bill Clinton kept numerous audio recordings that the archives wanted, but were unsuccessful at getting after going to court. We won't even mention what is going on with the White House in the current, or various past administrations.  Also, another fake story, that I flushed papers and documents down a White House toilet, is categorically untrue and simply made up by a reporter in order to get publicity for a mostly fictitious book.

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-xf5kjjgnue1504,"Why isn’t the corrupt Unselect Committee of political hacks and highly partisan sleazebags in Washington investigating the massive voter fraud and irregularities that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election, rather than spending all of its time investigating those who were protesting its result? It was the Crime of the Century! Large-scale proof of fraud and serious irregularities exist all over the place. Also, why is Crazy Nancy Pelosi and her files, which reportedly have been largely destroyed and deleted, not under investigation for not properly securing the Capitol with Soldiers or the National Guard that were strongly recommended to her by me and others? I knew the crowd would be extraordinarily large because they were protesting the RIGGED ELECTION. Capitol security was her job, not the President’s, and the American people now know that. If she did with security what she should have, there would have been no “January 6” as we know it. The Fake Unselect Committee wants nothing to do with that subject because they know it was the fault of Nancy Pelosi and, to a lesser extent, the Mayor of D.C. So, if I recommend Soldiers and if she refused to use them, why am I, and those around me, responsible for anything? We’re not, plain and simple!"

This massive fundraising accomplishment does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars raised by other candidates and organizations who use President Trump’s name, likeness, endorsement, and America First Agenda as a platform for their efforts, further strengthening the movement he began in 2016.  Taylor Budowich, Director of Communications for President Trump and Save America PAC, said, “President Donald J. Trump has built a political organization that continues to capture and define the future of the Republican Party. From the massive and unprecedented Save America Rallies, to these record-breaking fundraising numbers, there is no question that the MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN (MAGA!) wave is set to crash across the Midterms and carry forward all the way through 2024.

If it were sent back to the legislators, or if Nancy Pelosi, who is in charge of Capitol security, had taken my recommendation and substantially increased security, there would have been no “January 6” as we know it! Therefore, the Unselect Committee should be investigating why Nancy Pelosi did such a poor job of overseeing security and why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval, in that it has now been shown that he clearly had the right to do so!"

2022-01-07,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-wyehrxkcnt1383,"What we witnessed yesterday was the last gasps of a corrupt and discredited left-wing political and media establishment that has, for decades, driven our country into the ground—shipping away our jobs, surrendering our strength, sacrificing our sovereignty, attacking our history and values, and trying to turn America into a country that our people can barely recognize. These radical leftists in Washington care NOTHING for American Democracy. All they care about is control over you, and wealth and riches for themselves. But they are failing. No one believes them anymore. And the day is quicky coming when they will be overwhelmingly voted out of power. Joe Biden’s voice is now the voice of desperation and despair. His handlers gave him that speech to read yesterday because they know the unprecedented failures of his presidency and the left-wing extremism of the Pelosi-Schumer Congress have destroyed the Democrat Party. Part of their panic is motivated by the realization that, just like the Russia Collusion Hoax, they cannot sustain the preposterous fabrications about January 6 much longer. The truth is coming out. But for them, the worst part of it all is the knowledge that the American People are seeing right through their phony media event—which despicably compared a Pelosi-led security failure at the Capitol to the darkest days in American history and the deaths of 3,000 Americans. The people see right through that sham. They see a cynical politician who ran for office promising unity who is now doing the most divisive thing possible—slandering his political opponents as domestic terrorists, just like insecure dictators do in communist countries. The American People also see that January 6 has become the Democrats’ excuse and pretext for the most chilling assault on the civil liberties of American citizens in generations. It is being used to justify outrageous attacks on free speech, widespread censorship, de-platforming, calls for increased domestic surveillance, appalling abuse of political prisoners, labeling opponents of COVID lockdowns and mandates as national security threats, and even ordering the FBI to target parents who object to the radical indoctrination of their children in school. And this week, January 6 is also the Democrats’ excuse for trying to pass a radical Federal takeover of state election law. They are trying to BAN voter ID and other basic measures that can ensure the sacred integrity of the vote. The reason the Democrats are doing all of this is not because they believe they will win a fair and honest election. It’s because they know they will overwhelmingly LOSE one. Remember, I am not the one trying to undermine American Democracy—I am the one trying to SAVE American Democracy. Today, I am more confident than ever in the strength and common sense of the American People. They are counting the days until we will no longer have to be constantly lectured, lied to, and dictated to by corrupt politicians and their media partners. When we will no longer have to put up with this broken establishment’s hoaxes and its manufactured media narratives—And as Biden and his radical handlers know, that day is coming fast. Because in the months and years ahead, the American People are going to speak up, take action, and VOTE in massive numbers, and we are going to TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY. From the very beginning, all that Americans have wanted is great jobs, safe neighborhoods, strong borders, good schools, a proud nation, and a government that LISTENS to the American People. That is what our movement has always been about—and that is what we are focused on to this day. Joe Biden and the Radical Democrats have failed on every front. But do not lose hope. America WILL be Great Again."

They're the ones who tried to stop the peaceful transfer with a rigged election. Just look at the numbers. Does anybody really think that Biden beat Obama with the Black population in select Swing State cities, but nowhere else? That he would lose 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, and 27 out of 27  “toss up” House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails? That he would lose Florida, Ohio, and Iowa and win, even though it has never been done before?They spread a “web of lies” about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too. Big Tech was used illegally.Where did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece, or in Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Wisconsin. He acts like he's aggrieved, but we're the ones who were aggrieved and America is suffering because of it with poisonous Borders, record Inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, $5 a gallon gas and higher, empty stock shelves, and rampant crime. America is a laughingstock stock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection, which took place on November 3rd, but this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us.Never forget the crime of the 2020 Presidential Election.

This political theater is all just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed. Our Country no longer has Borders, has totally and completely lost control of Covid (record numbers!), is no longer Energy Independent, Inflation is rampant, our Military is in chaos, and our exit, or surrender, from Afghanistan was perhaps the most embarrassing day in the long and distinguished history of the United States—and so much more. Why is it that the Unselect Committee of totally partisan political hacks, whose judgment has long ago been made, not discussing the rigged Presidential Election of 2020? It’s because they don’t have the answers or justifications for what happened. They got away with something, and it is leading to our Country’s destruction. They want all conversation concerning the Election “Canceled.” Just look at the numbers, they speak for themselves. They are not justifiable, so the complicit media just calls it the Big Lie, when in actuality the Big Lie was the Election itself. The Democrats want to own this day of January 6th so they can stoke fears and divide America.

In my administration, we respected the role of Governors to take care of their own states, and they could request antibodies and therapeutics depending on what they needed. That’s the way our Country is supposed to be run. Now, there’s talk by the Biden Administration again about closing schools and even vaccine mandates for school children. This is an outrage, and MAGA nation should rise up and oppose this egregious federal government overreach. The Democrats are so incredibly mandate happy—there is discussion about a vaccine mandate for school kids this year in Detroit and other Democrat-run places. Our administration did what they said could not be done—vaccines in record time. But we never issued mandates, and I never would! People should be able to choose how they want to govern their own health.

NO ONE respects Joe Biden, and the world is a much more dangerous place as a result.Biden’s Year of Mortifying Failures:Biden’s Afghanistan Surrender was the worst foreign policy humiliation in American history.Shameful weakness on CHINA—no accountability on Virus, Biden team openly MOCKED and insulted by Chinese diplomats.Begging and pleading Iran for nuclear “deal” while regime laughs, racing toward nukes.Backstabbing and insulting ISRAEL—after Biden put our Israeli friends in mortal danger.Russia now engaging in increasingly aggressive behavior including massing troops on Ukraine’s border, because they do not fear or respect Biden.Bitter betrayals of America’s closest allies draw STINGING REBUKES from abroad.Obliterating America’s borders and returning to the failed ideology of globalism.Falling asleep at global summits; gaffes draw guffaws from other world leaders.Forcing our brave warriors in the U.S. Military to endure trainings in toxic Critical Race Theory.No accountability for Woke Generals who lose, leak, lie and obsess over their press clippings.Weakest and most partisan national security team in history—Harris, Sullivan, Blinken, Milley, and Austin—have NO CREDIBILITY, and have lost the confidence of the entire world.Lectures about democracy while trampling the Constitution here at home...·         Thinks “global warming” is number one national security threat…The most clueless president in U.S. history is leading the world into chaos.BIDEN’S AFGHANISTAN SURRENDER: HIS BOTCHED EXIT WAS THE MOST ASTONISHING DISPLAY OF INCOMPETENCE BY ANY LEADER IN PERHAPS THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.Either they didn’t see it coming or they flat-out lied—either way it’s totally disqualifying.April 14, Biden:“We will not conduct a hasty rush to the exit…We’ll do it responsibly, deliberately, and safely.”June 7, Blinken: “Whatever happens in Afghanistan, if there is a significant deterioration in security… I don’t think it’s going to be something that happens from a Friday to a Monday.”June 17, MILLEY:“I don’t see Saigon 1975 in Afghanistan... The Taliban just aren’t the North Vietnamese army. It’s not that kind of situation.”July 2, Biden: “We’re on track exactly as to where we expected to be…It’s a rational drawdown with our allies, and… there’s nothing unusual about it.” Asked a follow-up on Afghanistan, Biden replied, “I want to talk about happy things, man.”July 8, Biden: “The likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.” Biden promised, “There’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy in the—of the United States from Afghanistan.”ABANDONED BAGRAM AIR BASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN EARLY JULY– AMONG THE WORST MILITARY DECISIONS OF ALL TIME—PAVING THE WAY FOR CATASTROPHE.The U.S. military inexplicably left Bagram Airfield—built at MASSIVE taxpayer expense—without telling the Afghan Security Forces, months before all Americans had been evacuated from Afghanistan. This horrendous decision left the U.S. military without a defensible base of operations, and allowed 5,000 dangerous terrorists and hardened criminals imprisoned at Bagram to later be set free by the Taliban—one of whom was the suicide bomber who killed more than 180 people and 13 U.S. servicemembers in the Kabul airport attack.General Milley had assured Congress on June 23: “Bagram is not necessary, tactically or operationally.”A month later, the Taliban took control of its first Afghan province.BIDEN DID IT ALL BACKWARDS: FIRST he removed the troops, THEN he abandoned the bases, and ONLY THEN did he try to evacuate our diplomats and civilians.Biden went on VACATION as the Taliban took over—took NO RESPONSIBILITY for the crisis, cast blame on everyone else.He spent only 4 of 15 days in the White House as Afghanistan was overrun.Even the left-wing media could not excuse it…“He said the buck stopped with him but in fact the speech was full of finger pointing and blame… he did not get into, or accept any blame for, the catastrophic exit we've been watching on television in the last several days.” – Jake Tapper, CNN“There's a serious disconnect between the messaging from the Biden administration…And then what we're seeing on the ground…The Biden administration needs to do two things: One, to actually get that situation under control and then two, to be upfront with the American people about what's going on. They can see it with their own eyes at this point.” – Julie Pace, AP“You have to question, is the president insulated, isolated?...On Friday it was almost bizarre. What he was saying did not match the reality of what some of his other advisers were saying.” – Jeff Zeleny, CNN“We know that’s not true. We know there are many instances where that has not been true… He also said Al Qaeda is gone from Afghanistan, but…we know that is also untrue. Why is he misleading with his words here?” – Brianna Keilar, CNNProminent Democrats and Establishment Figures were shocked too…Obama’s former Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, said, “With the Taliban now controlling Afghanistan, there is no question that they will provide a safe haven for Al Qaeda and for ISIS.”Obama’s former CIA Director, David Petraeus, said, “This is a Dunkirk moment or, perhaps, a Saigon moment.”Obama’s former Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, said that Biden’s exit was “an indelible stain on his presidency.”Our Allies Were ENRAGED and HORRIFIED…For the first time in history, the British Parliament held an American President, Joe Biden, IN CONTEMPT—calling his actions “catastrophic,” “shameful,” and “dishonorable.”U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was reportedly stunned and infuriated when he could not even get Joe Biden on the phone while British lives were on the line.Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair called Biden’s actions “imbecilic.”French Parliamentarian Nathalie Loiseau said, “We thought America was back, while in fact, America withdraws.”German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called Biden’s handling “shameful for the political West.”Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen lost faith in the ability of the U.S. to protect Taiwan from China saying, “It is not our option to do nothing and only rely on others for protection.”America’s Adversaries Watched Biden’s Surrender with Glee…China’s Foreign Ministry taunted Biden, saying that the Afghanistan withdrawal shows that the U.S. should not “interfere in other countries’ internal affairs,” alluding to Taiwan.Putin’s foreign policy advisor chuckled saying, “You can’t blame Russia for feeling a little smug about what is happening in Kabul.Iran’s President mocked Biden at the United Nations saying, “Today, the U.S. does not get to exit Iraq and Afghanistan but is expelled.”Hezbollah’s Secretary General said Biden had “accept[ed] a historic failure.”Taliban fighters chanted “Death to America” outside the American embassy in Kabul.Yet Biden claimed he had seen no indication of damage to American credibility in the world.AFTER LOSING KABUL, BIDEN CREATED A NIGHTMARE AT THE KABUL AIRPORT AND PUT AMERICANS AT THE MERCY OF THE TALIBAN.The Washington Post reported that before entering Kabul, the Taliban offered to allow the U.S. military to remain in control of the city to evacuate Americans. But the Biden administration said no, they just needed the airport. Biden had no other plan than to beg for mercy from America’s enemies.After greenlighting the sudden conquest of Kabul by the Taliban and then promising to evacuate as many Afghans as possible, Biden triggered a NIGHTMARE at the airport. Then, he refused for days to establish a wider security perimeter to ensure the safety of all involved.The Biden Administration said it was unable to help Americans flee to the Kabul airport, even while British and French commandoes went all over town rescuing their citizens.According to POLITICO, the Biden administration gave the Taliban what was effectively a kill list “of names of American citizens, green card holders and Afghan allies.” Biden himself said “there may have been” a kill list.On August 17, Biden’s National Security Advisor said, “There have been instances where we have received reports of people being turned away or pushed back, or even beaten. We are taking that up in a channel with the Taliban.”BIDEN’S STUNNING INCOMPETENCE ALLOWED A HORRIFIC TERRORIST ATTACK, DEADLIEST DAY FOR U.S. FORCES IN A DECADEOn August 26, radical Islamic terrorists carried out a suicide bombing outside the Kabul airport, killing 13 American troops and over 180 civilians, and badly injuring countless more.During the dignified transfer ceremony for our 13 American heroes, Biden disrespected the families of the fallen by looking at his watch at least three times.Biden loaded the planes evacuating Kabul with tens of thousands of unvetted Afghans before all Americans were out—and they weren’t even the Afghans who worked with America—then Biden left countless of Americans behind Taliban lines.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas stated that out of the 60,000 Afghans Biden loaded on flights, only 3 percent were Special Immigrant Visa holders who helped the U.S. during the past 20 years.CENTCOM Commander General Kenneth McKenzie said, “We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out” and confirmed that “hundreds” of Americans were left behind in Afghanistan.On August 31, the U.S. embassy in Kabul officially suspended operations. That day, Biden’s Pentagon spokesperson said, “We have Americans that get stranded in countries all the time.”According to the New York Post, in November, “Nearly three months after the last US military plane departed Afghanistan, the Pentagon is still trying to rescue family members of American troops in the war-torn country and is working to compile a database of those left behind, according to a report.”Meanwhile tens of thousands of unscreened, unvetted Afghan nationals were brought into the United States, including those with CHILD BRIDES.One Afghan national was promptly charged with sexually assaulting a child, another with strangling and beating his wife. And in New Mexico, a group of male Afghan evacuees reportedly ganged up on a female American service member and assaulted her.BIDEN SURRENDERED TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN U.S. MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE TALIBAN—WHICH IS NOW AMONG THE BEST EQUIPPED MILITARIES IN THE WORLD.According to an Axios report, the Taliban took control of “a massive new war chest, complete with U.S.-made Humvees, planes, helicopters, night-vision goggles and drones,” over 2,000 armored vehicles and up to 40 aircraft as well as UH-60 Black Hawks, scout attack helicopters, and ScanEagle military drones.How did Biden fall for the line that it was “cheaper” to leave billions of dollars in equipment than to fly it to nearby bases???The Biden administration ordered federal agencies to “scrub their websites” of all the details of the $85 billion in equipment the United States had given the Afghan security forces (now in the possession of the Taliban).BIDEN THEN BLEW UP INNOCENT AFGHANS IN A DISASTEROUSLY FAILED AIRSTRIKEReeling from their failures and trying to look tough in the midst of chaos, the administration executed what General Milley called “a righteous strike” that supposedly prevented another terrorist attack on the Kabul airport.In truth, the strike ended up killing no terrorists but mistakenly killed 10 innocent civilians, including 7 children.The man they claimed was a terrorist was actually a U.S. aid worker who worked for 14 years for a California-based charity that fed hungry Afghans.A New York Times expose revealed that the alleged bombs were jugs of water for his family.Days later, Biden BRAGGED about the strikes and proclaimed that the Afghanistan withdrawal was an “EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS” and said, “THIS IS THE WAY THE MISSION WAS DESIGNED.”Apparently it was all part of the plan…Unbelievably, Biden administration staffers then went around complaining to the media that they weren’t being given proper credit for the operation’s success.To date, no senior military, intelligence, or political official in the Biden administration has been fired for their conduct related to Afghanistan.Biden’s Afghanistan debacle was the POLAR OPPOSITE of President Trump’s strength and conditions-based approach.Biden did not follow “Trump’s plan” as he falsely claimed—Biden DISCARDED the Trump plan, came up with his own plan (to get a good press story on 9/11) and then he mismanaged the whole thing beyond belief.When one American soldier was killed in 2019 by the Taliban, President Trump called off talks with the Taliban and bombed the Taliban ferociously for days. That is why for over a year, not a single American service member had been killed in combat in Afghanistan – because they knew America was not to be trifled with.The Trump administration’s plan for Afghanistan was conditions-based. It required the Taliban to successfully negotiate a political settlement with the Afghan government. Biden clearly did not follow that plan because the conditions were never met.The Taliban knew that if they stepped out of line while Donald Trump was president, he would hit them harder than they had ever been hit before—just like he eliminated Baghdadi and Soleimani.This calamity would NEVER have happened under President Trump—and everyone in the world knows it.BUT THE AFGHANISTAN CATASTROPHE IS JUST THE BEGINNING….BIDEN’S WEAKNESS HAS INVITED NEW THREATS AND CRISES ALL OVER THE WORLD – WITH RUSSIA MASSING TROOPS ON UKRAINE’S BORDERPutin is reportedly considering a military offensive with 80,000-175,000 RUSSIAN TROOPS on Ukraine’s border.Russia is issuing threats and ultimatums to the United States, and even threatening to cut off relations with the U.S. entirelyIt’s all happening because Russia has no fear of doddering Joe Biden.Last spring, desperate for a summit with Putin to distract from his many failures and sagging poll numbers, Biden lifted President Trump’s sanctions on Russia’s Nord Stream II Pipeline—pushing Europe into dependence on Russian energy.The summit was a disaster, and Biden’s staff was too afraid to even allow him to do the usual Joint Press Conference.When suspected Russian hackers shut down a major pipeline in the U.S.—causing filling stations around the country to run dry—the Biden administration did nothing, disclaimed any responsibility for solving the problem, and allowed the Colonial Pipeline to pay nearly $5 million in ransom.By contrast, despite Democrat and media HYSTERIA, President Trump was tougher on Russia than any president since the end of the Cold War.He armed the Ukrainians with lethal weapons.He armed Poland, moved in thousands of troops, and negotiated a permanent U.S. military base there.He imposed crippling financial sanctions.He got NATO allies to increase defense spending by $400 billion, while rebuilding the U.S. military with $2.5 trillion.He rebuilt the U.S. nuclear stockpile.He withdrew from the INF Treaty.And he undermined Russia’s number one source of wealth by making the United States energy independent and exporting American natural gas to Eastern Europe—and all over the world.The comparison with Biden and his Russia-Hoaxing National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is not even close.CATERING TO IRAN, BETRAYING ISRAEL – BIDEN SIDES WITH WORLD’S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR WHILE GETTING OUR CLOSEST MID-EAST ALLY ATTACKED WITH ROCKETSIn a radical departure from President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign on Iran, Biden gave Iran unilateral sanctions relief before getting any concessions. Later the same year, he lifted more sanctions on multiple Iranian energy companies and former officials. In October, the administration lifted yet more sanctions, this time from two Iranian missile producers. Yet he has gotten NOTHING in return.Upon taking office, Joe Biden and John Kerry immediately began pleading with Iran to negotiate a return to the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal (which paved Iran’s path to a bomb with American dollars)—yet despite the fact that the Iranians are NOT INTERESTED, Kerry and Biden keep on begging.The Iranian foreign minister has even claimed that John Kerry informed him about attacks Israel was conducting on Iranian forces. How has this betrayal not been investigated?No doubt sensing whose side the Biden administration is on, Iran tested to see how far they could push—letting their terrorist proxy Hamas unleash a wave of violence.In May, the radical Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists launched over 4,000 rockets at Israeli population centers. 10 people died in the attacks.Biden REFUSED to directly condemn Hamas as a terror group.While Israel was still directly under missile fire from radical terrorists, Biden called to admonish Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, saying he “expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire,” as if Israel was at fault for trying to stop the rockets.Biden also gave hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Palestinian groups with no meaningful way to ensure it does not end up strengthening Hamas.By contrast, President Trump supported Israel and stood up to Iran like never before.He withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal and put the toughest-ever sanctions on the regime.He kept his promise, recognized the capital of Israel, and moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem.He also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.And he negotiated the most important Middle East peace deals in generations between Israel and four of its Arab neighbors, the Abraham Accords.CAVING TO COMMUNIST CHINA ON COVID– YES JOE, CHINA IS INDEED “EATING YOUR LUNCH”During the Democrat primaries, Biden scoffed at the idea that China was a major rival. “China is going to eat our lunch?” Biden asked incredulously.“They can’t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the East, I mean the West.”It’s no wonder Joe Biden was China’s choice for President: He supported giving them most favored nation trade status, celebrated their entry into the WTO, and during his vice presidency repeatedly lauded the Chinese regime. China rewarded Joe handsomely after he left office, offering “the Big Guy” and his family MILLIONS of dollars in Chinese “business deals”—not to mention Hunter’s 2.8 carat diamond.Now Biden is returning the favors, LETTING CHINA OFF THE HOOK FOR COVID.One of the Biden administration’s first actions was to shut down President Trump’s State Department investigation into the origins of the China Virus.Biden quickly returned the United States to the World Health Organization—which, as events proved, is practically owned by the CCP. And he went back in at “full price”—giving them $200 million in exchange for nothing—after they let China control the investigation into the “origins” of the China Virus.During his teleconference summit with President Xi, Biden failed to bring up China’s refusal to cooperate with the investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. How can that be?Biden also did not even MENTION China—or the origins of the virus—in his embarrassingly weak and stunningly vacuous address to the United Nations General Assembly.Earlier this year, Biden’s representatives—Blinken and Sullivan—were openly MOCKED by China on American soil at the Alaska summit.Chinese officials lambasted the American negotiators with talking points ripped straight from Critical Race Theory and told them that the U.S. “does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.” Biden said he is PROUD of his team—after they sat there and did not defend America.Biden even chalked up China’s Uighur Genocide to “DIFFERENT NORMS.”He made a long, strange, bizarre defense of the Communist Party’s brutal conduct, casting China as the victim and suggesting that human rights abuses promote Chinese “unity”:“If you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been, the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home. So the central — well, vastly overstated — the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that… Culturally there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow.”HOW MANY OF HUNTER BIDEN’S “PAINTINGS” does China have to buy in exchange for this level of weakness?Under President Trump, we stood up to China like never before, imposing strong tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, leading a global campaign against Chinese cybersecurity threat Huawei, prosecuting intellectual property theft, revitalizing the “Quad” alliance, speaking out for victims of religious persecution, and demanding in his 2020 United Nations Address that China be held accountable for unleashing the Virus upon the world.JOE BIDEN DECLARED THAT “AMERICA IS BACK”—BUT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS A CONTINUING CATASTROPHE ON THE WORLD STAGE….FRANCE ALIENATED: Our oldest ally withdrew its ambassador for the first time in U.S. history after Biden EXCLUDED them from a new security pact between the U.S., Australia, and the U.K.—behavior France called “BRUTAL.” During a meeting with President Macron in October, Biden admitted that his handling “was not done with a lot of grace.”“SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP” THREATENED: Biden has REPEATEDLY insulted and offended British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Biden elbowed his way into sensitive Brexit negotiations to UNDERMINE the British position. Just before going to the G7 in England, Biden’s representative delivered an insulting “demarche” to Britain’s top Brexit negotiator, slamming Johnson’s government. Pelosi threatened to BLOCK a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, and when Boris Johnson visited the White House in September, Biden’s staff rudely interrupted the U.K. Prime Minister in mid-sentence when he tried to take a few questions from the press. What exactly were they worried about?BORDERS THROWN WIDE OPEN: Among Biden’s most devastating disasters, he threw open the Southern Border to transnational criminal cartels who import gangs, drugs, and dangerous criminals. BORDER SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY.CORRUPT GLOBALISTS INVITED TO INVESTIGATE AMERICA FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES: Biden re-entered the notorious U.N. Human Rights Council, then Blinken enthusiastically invited the world’s worst human rights abusers and violators to investigate America for “systemic racism” and “human rights” abuses. Then Biden’s UN Ambassador declared that “white supremacy” is woven “into our founding documents and principles.”Great representatives for America on the world stage.MARXIST CRITICAL RACE THEORY BEING FOISTED ON MILITARY: The Navy’s Professional Reading Program suggested that military members read books that attack every aspect of America–including the very Constitution that servicemembers swear to defend. The NDAA includes funding for woke radicalism, including “equity” and CRT training. Chairman Mark Milley told Congress he wanted to “understand white rage” and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday suggested servicemembers read a radical manifesto openly calling for racial discrimination. Why do they even still have their jobs?SEVERE CUTS TO MILITARY FUNDING AND READINESS: Biden requested $7 billion less in funding for the Army than what was necessary to keep pace for inflation—and his budget calls for a force reduction of nearly 5,000 troops—even while Army Chief of Staff James McConville says “I’m very, very concerned about the size of the Army.”SO CONSUMED WITH LEFTIST IDEOLOGY THEY CAN’T SEE STRAIGHT: Biden declared that the Joint Chiefs of Staff told him “the greatest threat facing America” was “global warming.” In his Joint Session Address, Biden declared that “the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today” is “white supremacy.”ASLEEP ON THE JOB: After warning Pentagon officials in June that global warming will be the greatest national security threat in coming years, Biden fell asleep with his mask on at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference during the opening statements. He had to be awoken by his staff.SQUANDERING HISTORIC PEACE DEAL IN BALKANS: After President Trump’s administration brokered a groundbreaking agreement between Kosovo and Serbia, Biden let a key provision expire and has failed to build on the potential to permanently settle this long-simmering conflict.PUSHING RADICAL ABORTION AGENDA ON COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT WANT IT: Biden withdrew from President Trump’s Geneva Consensus Declaration, which affirms there is no international human right to abortion. Now the Biden administration is going around Latin America trying to bully nations that morally object to abortion into aborting more of their babies even though they do not want to. Under Biden, $32.5 million taxpayer dollars will also flow to the United Nations Population Fund which has historically played a role in China’s coerced abortion and involuntary sterilization programs.SILENT ON THE CORRUPT CUBAN COMMUNISTS EVEN AS BRAVE CUBAN PATRIOTS RISK THEIR LIVES TO PROTEST EVIL REGIME: For months Biden refused to unequivocally condemn the Cuban dictatorship’s human rights abuses. When asked in July when Biden planned on speaking out against Cuba’s horrific communism, Biden’s press secretary replied, “Not at this time.” FAILING ON COVID, FAILING AT HOME, AND A DISASTER ABROAD—JOE BIDEN’S FIRST YEAR WAS AN UTTER CATASTROPHE."

2021-12-29,YEAR IN REVIEW: JOE BIDEN’S CASCADING DOMESTIC CATASTROPHES,/news/news-xc8y4sqykq1350,"In one year, Biden has caused a border crisis, an energy crisis, an inflation crisis, a labor crisis, a supply chain crisis, and a violent crime crisis—all while pushing the most radical left-wing agenda in history.THE MOST ANTI-WORKER, ANTI-FAMILY, ANTI-AMERICA PRESIDENT EVER: Joe Biden inherited the most secure border in history, the fastest economic recovery on record, historically low gas prices, hard-won American Energy Independence, a domestic manufacturing renaissance, and a nation poised to flourish like never before—all thanks to the America-First agenda of President Trump. It took less than 12 months for Biden and the extremists in his party to turn it all into crisis, chaos, misery, and woe. It’s no wonder Biden is ending his first year with his approval ratings tanking to an all-time record low.Even the media cannot cover up his dismal record of unrelenting failure:Inflation is the highest in nearly 40 years—decimating the wages and incomes of hardworking Americans.Gas prices have risen nearly 50% from one year ago.America’s southern border is GONE—with 2+ million illegal aliens flooding into the U.S. this year—the most ever recorded by far.Democrat-run cities across the country are hitting ALL-TIME HIGHS in murders and violent crime.Mass smash-and-grab robberies and lootings are taking place in cities and suburbs nationwide.Biden is pushing $5+ TRILLION in socialist spending bills crammed with nation-wrecking left-wing lunacy.Biden’s Radical Democrat Party is forcing CRT into our children’s schools, shoving male athletes onto women’s sports teams, pushing woke racism into our military, tearing down statues of Thomas Jefferson, desecrating our history, dismantling basic election-integrity measures, and breaking decades of precedent to use taxpayer dollars to fund late-term abortion and infanticide.It’s all happening exactly as President Trump predicted. Joe Biden is a DISASTER.THE “BIDENFLATION” DISASTER: IMPOVERISHING THE MIDDLE CLASS, CRUSHING THE AMERICAN DREAMBiden repeatedly promised that he would not raise taxes on anyone making “under $400,000”—a promise he has already tried to break many times.In reality, Biden’s out-of-control spending binge has triggered skyrocketing inflation that functions as a massive tax on EVERYTHING, at every income level—hitting working- and Middle-Class Americans hardest of all. Every American is poorer because Joe Biden is president.We have seen huge, double-digit increases in the price of cars, trucks, beef, bacon, eggs, sugar, pork, furniture, housing, and other staples of Middle Class life. But wages and incomes have not gone up to match.Real average weekly earnings (adjusted for inflation) have declined 8 months in a row—starting right after Biden signed his $2 trillion “American Rescue Plan” last spring.According to a December Gallup poll, 7 in 10 low-income Americans reported hardship due to rising prices.The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that Bidenflation will cost American families 6% of their budget this year, or $3,500—a humungous Biden tax increase on hardworking families.Joe Biden was WARNED about the inflation nightmare he was creating. In February, top Obama economic advisor Larry Summers warned publicly that Biden’s far-left agenda “will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.”But Biden did not listen, charging ahead with his socialist programs and saying in July of this year, “Some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that's not our view. Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we've seen are—were expected and expected to be temporary.”Biden’s Chief of Staff contemptuously dismissed concerns about rising costs as “high class problems.”Now Biden is preposterously trying to claim that his latest $5 trillion spending bill “will take the pressure off of inflation”—an idea that not a single credible economist anywhere in the world believes.Instead, Larry Summers continues to warn that “there is significant reason to think inflation may accelerate” even further.As Democrat Senator Joe Manchin said of Biden’s signature legislative priority: “This is a recipe for an economic crisis.”BIDEN’S ERA OF ECONOMIC MISERY: JOB HOPES DASHED, GROWTH FORCASTS SLASHED, MILLIONS OF FORGOTTEN AMERICANS DISAPPEARING FROM THE LABOR FORCEIn November, Biden claimed that “This recovery is faster, stronger, fairer and wider than almost anyone could have predicted.” FALSE.For the last four straight months, the number of jobs added to the economy fell short of expectations. Last month, the number of jobs created fell short of expectations by 360,000.The MISERY INDEX (a combination of the inflation and unemployment rates) has reached its highest level in nearly three decades under Biden.Consumer sentiment is now lower under Biden than at ANY time during the Trump presidency.Small business optimism fell to a record low after the election. Under President Trump, small business optimism soared to the highest level ever recorded.Biden’s socialist American Rescue Plan created a disastrous labor shortage by paying millions of people more money NOT to work—long after most Americans were vaccinated and Biden had declared victory over the pandemic.Record numbers of Americans have left the workforce under Biden, with 4.3 million dropping out of the workforce in August alone.Under Biden, the Congressional Budget Office has downgraded their long-term projections of economic growth compared to their estimates last year (even after the worst of the pandemic shutdowns).In July 2020, CBO projected average real GDP growth of 2.1% from 2025-2030. Now CBO is projecting that average real GDP growth will be just 1.6% for 2026-2031, marking a decrease of nearly 24%.The July 2020 report projected that real GDP growth would be well above 2% EVERY year from 2024-2028. CBO’s latest estimate projects that real GDP growth will not exceed 1.6% during ANY of those years.By contrast, President Trump’s economy SHATTERED PREDICTIONS.At the end of the Obama administration, the CBO projected 2 million jobs would be created within 3 years. Instead, America gained 7 million new jobs before the pandemic – more than three times the experts’ predictions.In the first 2 months of 2020 (before the pandemic), the U.S. economy added more jobs than CBO had projected would be created in the entire 12 months of 2020.The strong economy that President Trump built put America on track for a swift rebound after the pandemic. In 2020, third quarter GDP growth was the largest ever at 33.1 percent. Household net worth rose to an all-time high in Q2 2020.Unemployment quickly fell to half its pandemic peak. President Trump’s economy rapidly regained over half of the jobs lost, much faster than projected.The Trump economic recovery was the fastest in recorded history—with jobs regained 23 times faster than they were after the financial crisis in 2008 under the Obama-Biden administration.Even despite the pandemic and the pandemic-induced economic setbacks, Gallup found 56 percent of Americans felt that they were better off at the end of President Trump’s first term than they were when it started.NOW BIDEN IS PUSHING THE LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN AMERICAN HISTORY—PUNISHING AMERICAN WORKERS AND REWARDING OUTSOURCERS WHO SEND JOBS TO CHINAAccording to the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the Biden spending bill would RAISE TAXES on working families at virtually EVERY income level, and lower after-tax incomes of 80 percent of Americans.Even the liberal Tax Policy Center says Biden’s Build Back Better Act raises taxes on the Middle Class.The Biden tax plan is pro-China, anti-America. His plan would make the U.S. business tax rate dramatically higher than the tax rate in Communist China.Taking into account all taxes under Biden’s plan, the Democrat bill would give businesses an approximately 100 percent tax advantage to locate jobs in China, rather than in the United States. It’s a tax cut for outsourcers, paid for with the jobs and livelihoods of American Workers.Biden also rescinded President Trump’s “2-for-1” cap on job-killing regulations, and resumed the regulatory behemoth’s relentless mission to keep jobs out of the United States.Meanwhile, Biden promised in the campaign “not cut taxes for the super wealthy,” but that is exactly what he is fighting to do in his regressive tax plan.The “Build Back Better” bill provides nearly $300 billion to increase the cap on the state and local tax deduction. 98% of this tax cut would go to households making over six figures.While Biden’s policies hurt middle and low-income earners, President Trump’s America-First policies created the greatest economy in the history of the world:Record low African-American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates.Record low unemployment among Native Americans, individuals with disabilities, veterans, and those without a high school diploma.Unemployment for women also reached its lowest rate in nearly 70 years.Under President Trump, a record number of people between ages 25 and 34 were working.Record low poverty rates for Americans of every race and ethnic group—including record low Black and Hispanic American poverty rates.Real median-household income hit an ALL TIME HIGH.Income inequality dropped two years in a row and by the largest amount in over a decade.The bottom 50 percent of American households saw a 40 percent increase in their net worth.Wages rose fastest for low-income and blue-collar workers. Middle-class family income increased nearly $6,000—more than five times the gains during the entire Obama-Biden administration.BIDEN SINGLEHANDEDLY CREATED THE WORST BORDER CATASTROPHE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD—AN ECONOMIC, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND HUMANITARIAN NIGHTMARE OF UNPRECEDENTED PROPORTIONSBiden inherited the most secure border in American history:President Trump ENDED CATCH-AND-RELEASE, instituted HISTORIC ASYLUM REFORMS, and implemented EXPEDITED REMOVALS for illegal border crossers. When migrants trespassed across our borders illegally, they were caught, detained, and promptly sent back home.After the historic reforms President Trump put into place, illegal border crossings fell by almost 90%.In addition, by the time President Trump left office, over 700 miles of border wall had been fully funded and contracted out, over 650 miles of border wall had been built or were undergoing construction, and more than 450 miles of border wall had been fully constructed.The Trump administration deployed nearly 5,000 troops to the Southern border. In addition, Mexico deployed tens of thousands of their own soldiers and national guardsmen to secure their side of the US-Mexico border.President Trump’s policies kept the American People SAFE. The Trump administration deported nearly 20,000 gang members, including almost 4,500 members of the brutal MS-13 gang, from American communities.President Trump also instituted NATIONAL SECURITY TRAVEL BANS to keep out terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists by restricting travel from terror-afflicted countries—upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.Immediately upon taking office, Joe Biden deliberately blew our border security to smithereens and invited millions of illegal aliens from all over the world to enter our country illegally.Biden issued 94 Open Borders executive actions in his first 100 days.Biden STOPPED removals, STOPPED border wall construction, and INSTITUTED CATCH-AND-RELEASE across the entire southern border—OPENING PANDORA’S BOX.Biden canceled the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, ripped up President Trump’s historic asylum agreements with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to prevent fraudulent use of our asylum system to gain entry, he abolished the Trump administration’s prohibition on deadly sanctuary cities receiving federal funds, and abolished the plan to determine whether Census respondents were even American citizens.He ordered a functional shutdown of ICE, and turned all of America into a nationwide Sanctuary for criminal aliens, with thousands of dangerous illegal aliens previously arrested for crimes now being released back onto American streets.Biden also created thousands of NON-ENFORCEMENT ZONES around America where MS-13 can roam free and ICE is not permitted to go.The Biden administration even banned the use of the word ""illegal"" when referring to illegal immigration.Foreign leaders from the region pointed out the obvious: Joe Biden had personally provoked a GIGANTIC migration crisis.Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that “[e]xpectations were created that with the Government of President Biden there would be a better treatment of migrants. And this has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the border thinking that it is easier to do so.” He said, “They see him as the migrant president, and so many feel they’re going to reach the United States.”Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei said, “The message changed to, we’re going to reunite families and we’re going to reunite children. The very next day the coyotes were here organizing groups of children to take them to the United States.”Both leaders have been punished by the Biden White House for stating the truth.Biden’s actions launched a year of unprecedented border incursions—while the White House pretended they had NO IDEA what was happening.In March, Biden blamed the changing seasons for a 21-year high in illegal border crossings, saying, “It happens every year.” That month, illegal migrants gathered in Tijuana, Mexico with the following message printed on their t-shirts: “Biden please let us in!” In March alone, the Biden administration spent $86 million taxpayer dollars to put up illegal aliens in hotels in Texas and Arizona. Biden also put VP Kamala Harris in charge as “border czar”—after Harris had previously compared ICE to the evil KKK.In April, Biden said, “We’ve now gotten control” of the border. That month, a new high 178,795 illegal border crossers were apprehended on the U.S. border, the overwhelming number of whom were promptly released into the interior.In May, Harris blamed a new high 180,597 illegal border crossers on “the lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience” in South American countries.In June, the Biden White House declared that “the administration has made significant progress at establishing a well-managed and secure border.” That month, a new high 189,034 illegal aliens flooded across the border.In July, Biden said, “With Vice President Harris's leadership, we're getting at the root causes of why people are migrating for our southern border.” That month, a new high 213,593 illegal border crossings occurred. The Biden-Harris claim is that the United States must transform the entirety of Central America before they can secure America’s border.In August, Biden proclaimed, “There is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe… from the COVID-19 in other countries.” That month, 209,840 illegal aliens poured across the Southern Border. Biden’s own administration estimated that nearly 20% of illegal alien family units crossing the border were infected with the virus. Unlike for law-abiding American citizens, under Biden, there are no vaccine mandates or testing requirements for illegal border crossers.In September, Biden said he would visit the border “at some point,” a promise he has yet to fulfill. That month, 192,001 illegal aliens crossed the border into the U.S.In October, there were another 160,000+ illegal crossings.In November, illegal border crossings rose again to 173,000, with a record number of arrivals from Nicaragua and Venezuela. The overwhelming number were single illegal alien adultsIn total, in 2021, Biden has aided and abetted over 2 MILLION illegal aliens in entering the United States—and even that number is a huge understatement.Because vast sections of the border are currently not patrolled as agents are conscripted into providing FREE TRANSPORT SERVICES to shuttle illegal aliens into the interior, these numbers are only a proxy for the mass influx that is occurring.Nonetheless, over the five summer months between April and August, this imperfect proxy for illegal border crossings rose by 945%, 674%, 471%, 413%, and 319% compared to the same time the year before.Border patrol arrests of illegal alien drug smugglers have increased by 453%.Border patrol arrests of illegal alien sex offenders have increased 212%.Border patrol arrests of illegal alien murderers have increased by over 1,900%.DEADLY DRUGS are pouring across Biden’s open border with 11,000 pounds of ULTRA-LETHAL FENTANYL detected by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2021, more than double the amount seized in the year prior.Last month, the amount of meth seized at the border increased by 161% compared to the same time the year before.Biden’s cruel and inhumane policies are pushing migrant children into the arms of coyotes, human traffickers, and child-smugglers—and he does not care.Biden exempted unaccompanied minors from Title 42, triggering the LARGEST WAVE OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS IN HISTORY. A staggering 122,000 unaccompanied youths arrived in the span of one fiscal year—blowing every other record to bits.Biden also abolished the Trump administration’s National Security Travel Bans, and SURGED refugee admissions, including thousands of unvetted refugees from Afghanistan.He terminated crucial Trump immigration reforms including giving state and local governments authority over refugee resettlements, the suspension of welfare-dependent migrants, and the public-charge rule (ensuring new entrants do not become a burden on U.S. taxpayers). He rescinded the block on immigrants who will burden our public healthcare system, and he lifted President Trump’s suspension on most foreign workers and new green card recipients that ensured AMERICANS were first in line for jobs as the economy reopened.MEANWHILE, BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING MASS AMNESTY FOR MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS IN THE MIDST OF THIS APOCOLYPTIC BORDER CALAMITY.Biden’s socialist spending bill gives illegals welfare and government benefits, and free child tax credits. It eliminates caps on Green Cards, allows unlimited chain migration, and grants unlimited numbers of foreign nationals the ability to PURCHASE permanent U.S. residency and taxpayer benefits for the low price of $2,500. It allows the Big Tech giants to replace qualified Americans with cheap foreign workers. And it issues diversity visas SPECIFICALLY to the people who were rejected by our Travel Ban because they came from the most dangerous places on earth.THE BIDEN CRIME WAVE: BIDEN AND THE RADICAL LEFTISTS IN HIS PARTY HAVE UNLEASHED A TIDAL WAVE OF BLOODSHED AND CHAOS ACROSS THE COUNTRYDuring his campaign, Biden linked arms with the radical Defund-the-Police movement, calling the police “absolutely” systemically racist, and labeled rioters, looters, and arsonists “peaceful protestors.” When asked if he agreed “we can redirect some of the funding” away from the police, Biden said, “Yes! Absolutely.”The Biden-Sanders “Unity” Manifesto called for abolishing Cash Bail and releasing 400,000 criminals from jail.Vice President Kamala Harris also called for “reimagining” policing and applauded Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for defunding the police, while she donated to bail rioters, looters, and violent criminals out of jail.Months of anti-police rhetoric and violent riots incited by Biden, Harris, and other Democrat politicians resulted in the largest increase in America's homicide rate in modern history and the most economically destructive riots ever recorded.In office, Biden has surrounded himself with Defund-the-Police Radicals.Biden’s Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh, proposed redirecting $12 million away from the Boston Police Department as Mayor.Biden Justice Department Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta believes it is “critical” to “decrease police budgets and the scope, role, and responsibility of police in our lives.”Biden Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke asserted that “We must invest less in police.Crime in America’s largest cities (all Democrat-run) SKYROCKETED during the first part of the year, with a 24% increase in the murder rate over last year according to the latest data.12 major Democrat-run cities have now hit all-time homicide records—Philadelphia, Columbus, Toledo, St. Paul, Indianapolis, Austin, Albuquerque, and Tucson to name a few.Carjackings are also soaring in Democrat-run cities with “Chicago seeing a 44% increase, Washington, D.C. up 45%, and New York an 81% increase,” according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau.BIDEN’S WEAK ON CRIME JUSTICE DEPARTMENT has dismissed nearly half of federal cases against Portland rioters. Biden has pushed to end cash bail including for persons charged with violent crimes, moved to slash sentences for drug traffickers and made permanent a policy that allowed thousands of “at risk” federal prisoners to spend their prison sentences at home.Biden is also pushing legislation to strip officers of qualified immunity, an attack on law enforcement everywhere.It’s no surprise that, under Biden, police officers are leaving their forces en-masse. The retirement rate in police departments nationwide increased by 45% over 2020 and 2021 with another 18% of officers resigning from their positions. This depletion of experienced cops makes rare and tragic mistakes drastically more likely. Meanwhile, Biden’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate is driving even more officers off the job.Biden is hiring prosecutors who refuse to prosecute crime. He recently nominated Rachael Rollins to become the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. As District Attorney, Rollins refused to prosecute trespass, shoplifting, larceny, disorderly conduct, receiving stolen property, driving with a suspended license, breaking and entering, wanton or malicious destruction of property, threats, possession with intent to distribute, non-marijuana drug possession, and resisting arrest.Under this Radical Democrat leadership at the federal, state, and local level, the country is falling into TOTAL MEYHEM. From suburban Philadelphia to Chicago to San Francisco, lawlessness is breaking out, with waves of smash-and-grab robberies seen almost every dayIn Chicago, fourteen robbers barged into a Louis Vuitton store and left with over $100,000 in handbags. In San Francisco’s Central District, larceny and theft incidents are up nearly 90% and overall crime is up almost 52% through November.HOW BAD IS IT?The Biden IRS is issuing guidance that criminals must report stolen property as INCOME on their taxes.(“Stole something? IRS says stolen property and bribes must be reported as income” – USA Today, December 28, 2021)Under President Trump, we supported our police and law enforcement like never before.President Trump ENDED the Obama administration’s 8-year crusade against law enforcement, revitalized Project Safe Neighborhoods to step up prosecutions of violent criminals, made $760 billion in surplus military equipment available to protect officers in the line of duty, sent hundreds of federal officers to Chicago, Detroit, Albuquerque, and other cities to support local law enforcement through Operation Legend, supported the DEATH PENALTY for cop killers, and provided states $400 million dollars to hire MORE police.BIDEN’S ENERGY SURRENDER: CRUSHING AMERICAN WORKERS AND FAMILIES TO APPEASE RADICAL LEFT LUNATICSUnder President Trump, the United States achieved ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, became the number one oil and gas producer on earth, and a NET ENERGY EXPORTER for the first time in 70 years.Under the Trump administration, average annual gas prices fell to theirlowest level in more than 15 years, and American families SAVED $2,500 a year in lower gas prices and electric bills.President Trump APPROVED the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, opened ANWR to oil and gas exploration and development, rolled back burdensome and unnecessary regulations that hurt energy production, streamlined regulations for energy infrastructure permitting, slashed the time to approve drilling permits on public land in half, ended the War on Coal, CANCELLED the Obama administration’s so-called Clean Power Plan, and withdrew from the disastrous, one-sided Paris Climate Accord.At the same time, the air became 7 percent cleaner, and the U.S. reduced emissions more than any country in the Paris Agreement after the U.S. withdrew—reaching the lowest level in 25 years.Biden has systematically dismantled the foundations of American Energy Independence to satisfy AOC, Ilhan Omar, and the other extremists calling the shots in the Democrat Party.Biden CANCELED the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day—and then he approved the Russian Pipeline!He rejoined the Paris Climate Accord, which allows China and India to keep polluting while decimating U.S. manufacturing and punishing Middle Class Americans with an estimated $30,000 in increased energy costs for a family of four over ten years.Biden halted new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands, began onerous “reviews” of existing energy production permits, attacked oil and gas producers, closed off ANWR for drilling, and is currently considering a full fracking ban.He has targeted energy companies for crippling tax hikes, directed agencies to impose new regulations requiring companies to disclose “climate-related financial risk” (a strategy to promote “divestment” in the U.S. energy industry), and is currently considering a plan to shut down a pipeline in Michigan that transports over half-a-million barrels of oil a day. Meanwhile, his gigantic spending and “infrastructure bills” double-down on this fringe agenda by investing hundreds of billions in the socialist GREEN NEW DEAL.As a result, energy prices are soaring—helping drive the Bidenflation crisis.The consumer price index for energy rose by a whopping 33.3% over the last year; the index for gasoline rose by over 58%, and the index for fuel oil increased by over 59% since last year.Nationwide, gas prices are up 50% since this time last year.Because of Biden’s disastrous anti-energy policies, Americans using natural gas could pay up to 50% more on heating than they did last year. Those who use propane could spend as much as 94% more. (Energy Information Administration, “Short-Term Energy Outlook” – December 7, 2021)Now Joe Biden is begging OPEC for help—after he attacked domestic production and then picked a completely unnecessary fight with Saudi Arabia.To ease political pressure amid his collapsing approval ratings, Biden also recklessly tapped into the Strategic Reserve that President Trump filled up at bargain prices to be used in case of national emergency.Asked recently what he would do to lower gas prices, Biden admitted, “I must tell you, I don’t have a near-term answer.”Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm thinks the Biden energy crisis is FUNNY. Asked how Biden would address it, she declared, “That is hilarious. Would that I had the magic wand on this.”Meanwhile, absentee Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg (who deserted his job for 3 months in the midst of the largest supply chain crisis in American history) has proclaimed that Americans worried about gas prices should purchase an electric vehicle and they will “never have to worry about gas prices again.” Perhaps the Biden administration hasn’t heard that the average electric vehicle goes for almost $56,000, considerably more than the average American makes in a year.THE MOST RADICAL-LEFT ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY – WAGING WAR ON PARENTS, WAR ON FAMILY, WAR ON FAITH, WAR ON AMERICAN VALUES, AND WAR ON THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFEPROMOTING CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND OTHER MARXIST IDEOLOGIES – On his first day in office, Biden dissolved President Trump’s 1776 Commission that was dedicated to celebrating American history, and signed an Executive Order to push trainings in toxic Critical Race Theory throughout the federal government.INDOCTRINATING AMERICA’S CHILDREN– Biden’s Department of Education proposed a rule providing taxpayer funding for public schools to teach CRT and leftist attacks on the American founding, including the historically-discredited 1619 Project and a textbook that openly called for racial discrimination, claiming, “The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.UNLEASHING THE FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON PATRIOTIC PARENTS – Biden’s Attorney General ordered the DOJ and FBI to target parents showing up at school board meetings objecting to Critical Race Theory and leftist gender ideology being forced down their children’s throatsIMPOSING ILLEGAL GOVERNMENT DISCRIMINTION – From distributing lifesaving COVID treatments to providing loan relief for farmers, Biden has replaced the Constitution’s promise of equal treatment under the law with the Marxist principle of “equity”—code for government discrimination based on race and gender.DRIVING UP THE COST OF CHILDCARE– Biden’s socialist “Build Back Better” plan is projected to DOUBLE the price of childcare for hardworking Americans, with one study by one of the nation’s top economists showing that a typical family with an infant and a four-year-old would pay an additional $27,000 a year in childcare costs under Biden’s plan. Even left-wing analysts are admitting it is insane.MOST ANTI-LIFE PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME – Biden eliminated the Hyde Amendment in his budget and went all-in on taxpayer-funded abortion. He reversed the Mexico City Policy and is now sending U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund abortions globally, and he also eliminated the Trump administration order that restricted funding for the abortion industry here in the U.S.TAXPAYER-FUNDED PAYOFFS TO FAKE NEWS JOURNALISTS– BBB includes $1.7 billion to subsidize the payrolls of media organizations, an outrageous payoff and violation of journalists’ “independence.”SHAMELESS GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP OF FREE SPEECH – Press Secretary Psaki stated chillingly that the White House is “regularly making sure social media platforms are aware of the latest narratives” and believes that if a user is banned from one platform, they should be banned from ALL platforms.ATTACKING RELIGIOUS LIBERTYAND FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE – The Biden administration has moved to dismantle religious protections for churches and businesses, gut faith-based adoption, abolish girls’ sports, and require doctors to perform unalterable gender-transition surgeries on children without parental notification.ATTACKING THE SECOND AMENDMENT– Biden proposed a sweeping attack on the right to keep and bear arms in his widely-panned and bizarrely-delayed Address to a Joint Session of Congress. He also nominated a radical gun grabber to lead the ATF, an extremist who said he believed the government should “arrest [gun-owners] before committing crimes rather than responding after the fact.”RADICAL ASSAULT ON ELECTION INTEGRITY AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE– Biden and the Radical Left Democrats in Congress spent 2021 pushing legislation to usurp states’ sacred Constitutional authority to run their own elections. The Democrats are trying to institutionalize massive election “fraud-by-design.” Their legislation would ban Voter ID nationwide, mandate that states allow “ballot harvesting” (a well-known technique Democrat operatives use to cheat), and much, much more.RESUMING OBAMA’S CRUSADE TO ABOLISH THE SUBURBS – Biden reimposed Obama’s radical “AFFH” housing power-grab that puts leftist federal bureaucrats in charge of local zoning, so they can carry out the far-left’s war to abolish single-family home zoning nationwide.NO PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY HAS EVER CAUSED SO MUCH DAMAGE IN SO SHORT A TIME. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. "

Their whole campaign was a lie from Religion, to the Border, to the Military, to the Economy, to Inflation, to the loss of Energy Independence and, of course, most embarrassing of all, to the inept, grossly incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan.

2021-12-28,YEAR IN REVIEW: JOE BIDEN’S COVID DISASTERS,/news/news-mwuefadkkg1346,"One year in, Joe Biden is a failed president who has surrendered to the Virus and broken his number one promise to the American people: to end the pandemic once-and-for-all.A RECORD OF COMPLETE AND TOTAL FAILURE: Joe Biden was handed every tool he could have asked for by President Trump—3 vaccines, 5+ lifesaving therapeutics, vast quantities of medical and personal protective equipment, a full array of testing options for COVID (at-home tests, rapid tests, and PCR tests, none of which existed before) as well as a full year of data, study, and scientific knowledge. Yet despite all of this, Biden has failed so badly that more people died in 2021 than died in all of 2020.By Biden’s own standard, he should be removed from office. During the second presidential debate on October 22, 2020, Biden said, ""220,000 Americans dead… Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States.""Since Biden took office, 400,000 Americans have died from COVID-19.After Biden prematurely declared victory over the virus earlier this year, daily average cases have increased nearly 1,700%.Over 27 million Americans have been infected with the coronavirus on Joe Biden’s watch, and there are now an average of 243,000 new coronavirus cases every day—nearly 3x the 7-day rolling case average on Election Day 2020, and it’s going higher.There are now more than 70,000 people hospitalized, tens of thousands more than on Election Day 2020.The test positivity rate is higher today than any point since April 2020—and more than DOUBLE the rate on Election Day 2020 (7-day moving average).The White House is now projecting “a winter of severe illness and death.”In spite of this atrocious record and the fact that he based his entire campaign on COVID, Biden ended 2021 SURRENDERING to the Virus—just as he surrendered in Afghanistan. “There is no federal solution,” Biden said on December 27, 2021. “This gets solved at a state level.”On November 13, 2020, Biden lied about the Trump administration’s COVID record, stating: “This crisis demands a robust and immediate federal response, which has been woefully lacking.”JOE BIDEN VOWED TO “SHUT DOWN THE VIRUS, NOT THE COUNTRY”—BUT INSTEAD HE SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY, AND SURRENDERED TO THE VIRUS…JUST AS PRESIDENT TRUMP PREDICTED.Hundreds of schools are once again closing across the country as Biden admits defeat.“US alarm at rise in child COVID infections sees school closures back on agenda” – the Guardian, December 27, 2021.Thousands of flights are being canceled during Christmas week because of the Biden administration’s breathtaking failures.“Major US airlines canceled hundreds more flights Sunday, the third day in a row of mass cancellations and delays over Christmas weekend, as staff and crew call out sick amid the Omicron surge…More than 1,200 US flights were canceled and more than 5,000 were delayed Sunday, according to FlightAware.” – CNN, December 26, 2021.Biden’s top COVID advisor Anthony Fauci said the administration may ban unvaccinated Americans from domestic air travel.“Fauci says U.S. should consider adding a vaccine requirement for domestic flights” – Washington Post, December 27, 2021.Biden ordered private employers to fire unvaccinated Americans from their jobs as he blames the American People for his own failures.On December 4, 2020, Biden promised that he would never mandate vaccines, saying, “No I don't think it should be mandatory, I wouldn't demand it be mandatory.” Less than one year later, Biden imposed an unconstitutional federal vaccine mandate and threatened that any American who refused to comply should be “prepared to pay.”Biden’s public communication has been a confused mess—with rules and messages changing at a dizzying pace, yet Biden himself does not even follow them.On May 13, 2021, Biden said: “If you’ve been fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask. Let me repeat: If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.”Last week, Biden said, “Wear a mask.” “It’s critical to mask up in public indoor places.”Meanwhile, Biden goes galivanting around the nation’s capital without a mask while sick and coughing: “Biden is spotted maskless at DC restaurant after saying he caught a cold from his grandson” – the Daily Mail, December 4, 2021BIDEN’S DEADLY DISINTEREST IN THERAPEUTICS: SLOW TO INVEST IN AND DISTRIBUTE NEW AND LIFESAVING TREATMENTSThe Trump administration developed a proven system of speed, learning, iteration, innovation, and logistics that produced breakthrough weapons against the virus, and got them to Americans as quickly and plentifully as possible. The Biden administration has done the opposite: rested on their laurels while lecturing the American People and attacking their freedom.President Trump invested BILLIONS in therapeutic development and manufacturing as part of Operation Warp Speed, and approved and distributed five therapeutics on an accelerated timetable.Because of President Trump’s swift action, hundreds of thousands of critically ill patients received lifesaving treatments such as convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies.Under Biden, there are now widespread shortages of monoclonal antibodies, one of the most effective treatments for seriously ill patients. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has failed to follow through on bringing new antibody treatments to market to confront new variants. This is a disaster of gigantic proportions.Similarly, while maniacally demonizing Americans who have not been vaccinated and trying to get them fired from their jobs, Biden has FAILED to focus on purchasing and quickly distributing adequate supplies of groundbreaking therapeutic treatments, such as Pfizer’s new pill, Paxlovid, which was found to reduce risk of hospitalization or death by 88% when taken shortly after COVID infection.When asked how many doses of the lifesaving Pfizer pill the federal government had purchased, Biden replied that he couldn’t remember the precise number and added, “I hope we don’t get there because if people get the shots…they’re not going to be in a position where they’re going to need such a pill.”The Pfizer pill’s results were reported in early November, but nearly 2 months later, HHS says the first doses “will begin arriving at dispensing sites by the end of December” but that doses “will be limited at first” and “ramp up…in the coming months.” Many states are receiving only a few hundred doses, and some even less.While forecasting “severe illness and death” for the unvaccinated, the Biden White House has barely even mentioned Paxlovid. It has only been mentioned one time in a press briefing since November.Everyone knows this would never have happened under President Trump.BIDEN’S TESTING FAILURE: A NATIONAL SCANDAL – BIDEN IS NOW TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM HE CREATEDStarting completely from scratch on a novel virus, the Trump administration rapidly built the largest, most robust, and most advanced testing system in human history.By January 20, 2021, the United States had conducted over 250 million tests – the most in the world by far.Coronavirus testing peaked in January 2021 with approximately 2 million Americans getting tested a day.Since President Trump left office, testing has DECLINED on Joe Biden’s watch. Biden has presided over a STAGGERING DECAY of America’ testing infrastructure, leaving the United States UNPREPARED for the Omicron Surge.Biden stood by over the summer as millions of testing kits were destroyed, testing sites were dismantled, and testing manufacturers shut down production facilities and laid off workers. (“Maker of Popular COVID Test Told Factory to Destroy Inventory” – New York Times, August 20, 2021))The number of tests performed dropped to just 420,000 per day during the summer as the Delta variant began to spread.In October, the Biden administration REJECTED a plan that would have produced hundreds of millions more COVID tests and provided all Americans with free rapid tests for the holidays.Throughout the Christmas weekend, sick Americans waited for hours in long lines to get access to a COVID test, and many were turned away or met with empty shelves—nearly two years into the pandemic.As Biden admitted to ABC News, “You could argue that we should have known a year ago, six months ago, two months ago, a month ago.” He said he “wished [he] had thought about ordering” extra tests months ago.Projections by the Department of Health and Human Services now estimate the United States will need 3 to 5 million tests per day by January—but because of Biden’s failures, our testing capacity is nowhere close. (“HHS forecast shows Omicron stretching U.S. COVID testing supply” – Politico, December 15, 2021)Under Biden, the United States has fallen far behind other advanced nations on testing.In Europe, 46 rapid at-home antigen tests have been approved for use, while the FDA has approved just 14 at-home antigen tests—some of which were authorized by the Trump administration.One recent investigation found that under Biden, testing manufacturers applying for emergency use authorization face months-long delays.Under President Trump, new coronavirus tests were sometimes approved within 24 hours.Even the Washington Post is now criticizing Biden’s testing failures, noting that America has fallen behind the rest of the world.WASHINGTON POST: “Americans are still paying a pretty penny for at-home coronavirus tests, which run around $25 for a pack of two — if they can even find one. In contrast, stores in Germany and India sell tests for a few dollars. The United Kingdom provides seven free tests per day to anyone who wants them. Singapore mailed tests to every household.”Unlike Trump, Biden inherited the best testing system in the world and a virus we have known about for almost two years. But Biden still explained his failures by trying to claim that “nobody in the whole world saw it [the omicron variant] coming.”BIDEN RECKLESSLY POLITICIZED THE VACCINE—BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING OFFICEFor months during the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden and Kamala Harris deliberately fomented skepticism about the vaccine.In September 2020, Biden said, “Why do we think, God willing, when we get a vaccine — that is good, works — why do we think the public is gonna line up to be willing to take the injection? We’ve lost so much confidence, the American people, in what's said [by the Trump administration].” Biden said, “I don’t trust Donald Trump. And at this point, the American people can’t, either.”In September 2020, Harris said, “I would not trust Donald Trump” on a vaccine. During the vice presidential debate the following month, Harris said, “If Donald Trump tells us to take [the vaccine], I’m not taking it.”In February 2021, Biden falsely claimed “we didn’t have” the vaccine when he took office.But Biden himself received both of his vaccine doses before he took office, and when President Trump left office, over 1 million Americans were being vaccinated a day—all with NO MANDATES, THREATS, OR UNNECESSARY DIVISIVENESS.In October 2021 during a CNN town hall event, Biden claimed that America’s widespread vaccine availability was because “I went out and bought everything I could do and buy in sight and it worked.”Biden must have forgotten that it was President Trump who invested $14 billion in vaccine development and manufacturing.By the time Trump left office, the federal government had secured 464 million vaccine doses, enough vaccine doses for all eligible Americans to get the vaccine by June 2021.After inheriting the vaccines, Biden had a solemn obligation to monitor the data, keep the American people fully informed, and promote trust through transparency and communication. Instead, he has lied repeatedly and pursued nonsensical policies like denying natural immunity among those who have recovered from the virus—losing the trust of the American People.Biden is now blaming everyone but himself for his administration’s failures, while trying to divide and demonize his fellow Americans, and working with Big Tech giants to censor public debate and scientific discussion.As President, Trump was praised even by governors of the opposing party for his non-partisan and unifying approach to confronting this national challenge—and in the White House, he fostered open and vigorous debate among the full spectrum of people with different areas of expertise.BIDEN THREW OPEN AMERICA’S BORDERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC—HIS BORDER NIGHTMARE IS HELPING FUEL INFECTIONS AND DEATH.Biden halted construction of President Trump’s border wall on the first day he took office, tore up our national security travel bans, shredded our asylum cooperation agreements with Mexico and Central American nations, and implemented catch-and-release across the entire U.S. border—triggering a mass influx of illegal migration.Almost 2 million illegal aliens from over 160 countries have crossed America’s southern border this year alone—and the true number is much higher than that. There’s no “vaccine mandate” for illegal aliens on the border—yet while inviting in millions of unvaccinated illegal aliens to violate our laws, Biden is fighting to prevent American workers and American children from freely living their lives.As the Delta variant spread across the world, Biden’s own administration estimated that nearly 20% of illegal immigrant families who crossed the border were infected with COVID-19—yet Biden refused to stop the flood of illegal migrants.By contrast, early in the pandemic, President Trump acted swiftly to ban travel from China in January 2020–a measure that was praised by even Dr. Fauci for “saving lives” but denounced by Biden as “xenophobic” and “hysterical.”President Trump also closed the U.S.-Mexico Border to non-essential travel from Mexico, and took action to ensure that anyone entering the U.S. illegally would be quickly returned to their home countries.BIDEN IS BOWING DOWN TO CHINA – JOE JOINED CHINA’S “COVERUP” OF COVID ORIGINSOne of the first actions of the Biden administration was to shut down President Trump’s State Department investigation into the Wuhan lab.In August 2021, Biden said, regarding the origins of the China virus that, “The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them.” Biden also said, “we all must better understand how COVID-19 came to be in order to prevent further pandemics.”But a year into Biden’s presidency, Biden has FAILED to get the truth about the Wuhan lab and he has failed to hold China accountable.When Biden was asked two weeks ago why he has not done more to get to the bottom of the CCP’s role in the origins of the coronavirus, Biden just smirked and walked away.“Biden smirks when Post asks about pushing China for transparency after 800K COVID deaths” – New York Post, December 15, 2021The Biden administration has continually refused to hold China accountable for its role in the deadly spread of the coronavirus, opposing President Trump’s demand that China pay trillions of dollars for the damage it has caused.AN UNMATCHED RECORD: TRUMP’S COVID STRATEGY SAVED MILLIONS OF LIVES AND SAVED THE U.S. ECONOMYPresident Trump led the greatest mobilization of American society since World War II, quickly and decisively taking every problem head-on to save millions of American lives.Took swift and early action to impose a life-saving travel bans.Launched Project Airbridge, which led to the distribution of over a billion pieces of essential medical equipment at time of crisis, including:5 million N-95 respirators, 2.5 million face shields, 945 million gloves, 2.5 million thermometers, 127 million surgical masks, 1.4 million coveralls, 66 million gowns, and 109,000 stethoscopes.President Trump mobilized America’s manufacturing muscle—including Ford and General Motors—to produce vast quantities of personal protective equipment, and an unprecedented number of ventilators.Between January 2020 and January 2021, the number of ventilators in the national stockpile increased by 705%. Just as he promised, not a single American who needed a ventilator was denied a ventilator.President Trump rebuilt America’s strategic national stockpile, which by January 2021 had 18x more N95 masks, 10x more surgical masks, gowns, and gloves, and 3x more face shields than it had in January 2020. By contrast, the Obama-Biden administration left the national stockpile bare.To help reopen schools, President Trump provided over 100 million cloth masks for distribution to schools as well as 800,000 BinaxNOW tests to HBCUs.The Trump administration built the world’s leading testing system, completing over 250 million tests in 2020.The administration’s testing efforts created capacity for over 1.3 billion tests by June 2021.The administration protected our nation’s nursing home residents by shipping over 97 million pieces of PPE, over 15,000 antigen testing machines and 5.35 million rapid tests, as well as sending federal strike teams to 96 nursing homes across the country.The Trump administration invested $14 billion in vaccine development and manufacturing, and launched some of the largest vaccine trials in American history.Through Operation Warp Speed, President Trump harnessed the power of the federal government and scientific community to develop safe and effective COVID vaccines in just 9 months, the fastest in history.The Trump administration ramped up vaccine production to historic levels and secured enough vaccine doses for all eligible Americans by June 2021.President Trump prioritized vaccine doses to the most vulnerable Americans. As a result, 7 million people in over 70,000 long term care facilities rapidly received lifesaving vaccines.President Trump also expertly managed the economy’s safe and strategic reopening—SAVING the U.S. economy, rescuing millions of jobs, getting children safely back to school, and launching the fastest economic recovery on record.ONE YEAR IN, THE RESULTS ARE CLEAR: PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP HANDLED COVID EXCEPTIONALLY WELL—IN MUCH WORSE CIRCUMSTANCES—WHILE JOE BIDEN AND HIS DISASTEROUS ADMINISTRATION HAVE FAILED. IT’S NOT EVEN CLOSE."

This was a publicly stated challenge—I have been called a “ratings machine,” and therefore would be good for television economics—which have not been doing so well lately. With all the bravado out there, I have not had one credible person willing to stand up and debate me in order to defend the CROOKED election. All involved, like those on the Unselect Committee of January 6th, know that it is a losing proposition for them. The election numbers are not defensible. Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, and probably New Hampshire, Minnesota, New Mexico, and others were all won, and in some cases big, by a certain Republican Presidential Candidate, me. So, after one month, a very public offer to debate, I have no takers—not even the sleazebags you see on the January 6th Commission who speak with such fake reverence about the day. This is Cancel Culture. They think they got away with the Crime of the Century, and they don’t want it to be talked about or discussed.

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-rcd9sqmjuq1277,I'm hearing great things about Matt DePerno from delegates and party leaders in Michigan. He has been all over the Great State of Michigan gathering delegate and Republican Party endorsements and commitments. For far too long the Democrats have taken control of Michigan and pushed radicalism. Enough is enough! Matt is the true America First Agenda candidate and will make a great Attorney General. He is a patriot and the fierce fighter Michigan needs to overturn the failed policies of Dana Nessel and Gretchen Whitmer. I urge all Michigan delegates and party leaders to support Matt DePerno in the April Republican Endorsement Convention.

While she pretends that she suspended her short-lived campaign for New York Governor to go after me, she conveniently fails to mention that she couldn’t garner any support and her poll numbers were abysmal—she had no chance of even coming close to winning. Despite weeks of campaigning, she was losing to Governor Hochul by what would have been a massive landslide. She didn’t drop out of the race for a higher purpose, or to “finish existing business” (I wonder what that would be?). She dropped out because her campaign was a complete failure, possibly because the citizens of New York saw how unfairly and viciously she and other highly partisan New York Democrat prosecutors were treating President Donald J. Trump. It’s called Prosecutorial Misconduct. Rather than continue to waste her time and taxpayer resources on a long continuing Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and me, she should focus her attention on helping to resurrect the once Great State of New York where crime and poverty continue to wreak havoc, with murder, rape, drug sales, and just about every other form of crime at record levels, and now with a just-announced highest unemployment rate in the Nation. New York is dying before our very eyes, and all the Democrat Prosecutors are focused on is how we can get and punish Donald Trump, who many would say has done, over the years, a spectacular job for New York!"

They are destroying our Country! We have been put in a much worse negotiating position, but we have the “Trump Card,” and it’s called the Debt Ceiling. If they don’t drop this horrendous, Communistic style Bill that will be ruinous to all we stand for as a Country, we should not approve a Debt Ceiling increase. The Old Broken Crow has to be willing to play this hand, not like last time when he folded up like a cheap umbrella. Play it and mean it, because the Debt Ceiling is far less destructive than the Bill that they will otherwise successfully pass, especially when added to the “Unfrastructure” Bill that was just so stupidly approved. Republicans should not have allowed the separation, McConnell should not have given a two month reprieve, but it is what it is. Win with the Debt Ceiling, or resign! "

2021-11-17,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-fq9hpbxwxd1082,"When the Broken Old Crow, Mitch McConnell, agreed to a two-month extension, he allowed the Democrats to get their act together and pass the $1.2 Trillion “Non-Infrastructure” Green New Deal Bill, which is a disaster for America in that only 11% of the money will be spent on REAL Infrastructure, with most being spent on Green New Deal nonsense, with big tax increases. Its actual cost is over $2 Trillion, but the bigger disaster is yet to come in the next, much larger version of the Green New Deal, which some people say will be $5 Trillion. This was all allowed by Mitch McConnell’s incompetence and now I understand that a couple Republican Senators may get on board so that they can have yet another and even bigger victory, for the Democrats, while at the same time ensuring massive Inflation and the destruction of our Country as we know it. This is what happens when you allow a guy who lost an Election to take over the Office of the President. He obviously had no mandate, but they’re changing our Country and everything it stands for. Mitch McConnell couldn’t stop the first Bill so 19 Senators, including himself, joined in. That’s what he does—if you can’t beat them, join them. If he wasn’t so stupid and didn’t give the two-month extension, he could have stopped it all. Now he and his RINO friends will allow a much bigger and far worse Bill to pass, ruining our Country while giving the Democrats a great political lift, all at the same time. People, with the help of the Fake News Media, have already forgotten about the horrendous Afghanistan withdrawal, an economy and jobs that are in shambles, and so many other things. The good news is, they can’t forget about Inflation because it’s hitting them right in the face. This is the Broken Old Crow’s fault. He could have won it all using the Debt Ceiling—they were ready to fold. Now the Democrats have a big victory and the wind at their back. McConnell is a fool and he damn well better stop their “Dream of Communism Bill” and keep his Senators in line, or he should resign now, something he should have done a long time ago. Use the Debt Ceiling like it should have been used, you Old Broken Crow, to do so would hurt our Country far less than this horrible Bill. Any Republican in the House or Senate who votes for this Bill will never ever get a Trump Endorsement. Thank you, and good luck!"

She was a “backbencher” in the White House, and is now a nobody again. We put her out there to face the public as little as possible. It’s amazing how these people leave with respect and adoration for me and others in the White House, but as soon as CNN or other cameras get shoved in their face, or the losers from the The View ask a question, or money gets thrown at them, or someone writes a fake book, inglorious lightweights like Farah change so quickly. I watched this clown on television saying exactly what they wanted her to say and I watched the lies. Was she paid by low-ratings CNN? By the way, as soon as the Crime of the Century happened on November 3rd, I knew the Election was Rigged and Stolen, and never changed my view on that one bit. I did not go soft on the “Real” Big Lie, the Election Scam, and never will. Backbencher said I told her I lost the Election—never did. I virtually never even spoke to Farah (it’s like she didn’t even exist in the White House). Anybody who ever says that I thought the Election was legit, even for a moment, is wrong. All you have to do is look at the thousands of pages of documents and evidence—which continues to mount. When we told Alyssa to “hit the road,” she wrote a very nice letter stating that working for “Trump” was “the honor of a lifetime” and she was “deeply proud of the incredible things we were able to accomplish to make our country stronger, safer, and more secure.” Show the rest of the letter Alyssa, and explain why you wrote it!"

Lana Theis refuses to support a Forensic Audit and refuses to admit there was pervasive Voter Fraud in the 2020 Election. Think of it, nothing was found wrong in Detroit, one of the most corrupt cities in the U.S., whose elections over the years have been a joke.

2021-11-10,Highlights: President Trump’s Remarks at the NRCC’s Countdown to the Majority Event,/news/news-jr7ez52gnu1038,"“If we do our jobs and stick together, one year from today we are going to be watching a massive red wave sweep across our entire country and we are going to be celebrating the election of the largest house republican majority in American history.”“The democratic party is a house of cards ready to come tumbling down.”Click Here to Watch Highlights from President Trump's Remarks EXCERPTS FROM REMARKS OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP ON THE COMING RED WAVEI stand before you this evening to say that if we do our jobs, and if we stick together, then exactly one year from today, we are going to be watching a massive RED WAVE sweep across this country—and we are going to be celebrating the election of the largest House Republican Majority in AMERICAN HISTORY!What we saw last week was just the beginning—in Virginia, New Jersey, Seattle, and very importantly, Ohio with the Election of Mike Carey to Congress last week.Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and the entire Radical Democrat Party are headed for a political meltdown of unprecedented proportions. If Republicans can stick together, we can beat them in deep blue cities and states, and we can beat them ANYWHERE—but we must stay UNIFIED. If we are united, we will end Nancy Pelosi’s political career once and for all. ON THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTYTo save our country, the Republican Party must be the party that fights fiercely for the ECONOMIC interests of American Workers—the party that speaks boldly for the SOCIAL interests of American Families—and the party that stands proudly for the CULTURAL values of God-fearing American Patriots.Some call this American populism, some call it National Conservatism, I call it putting AMERICA FIRST. But whatever you call it, it is here to stay—and it is not just the BEST way to win, it is the ONLY way to win.The old Republican Party is gone FOREVER. The days of fighting endless wars, supporting nation-building, loose immigration policies, idiotic trade deals, and surrendering our culture to left-wing arsonists are OVER—and they are not coming back!We are now the Working People’s party. We will be tough on crime, strong on borders, strong on trade, proud of our heritage, and proud of our American values. We will defend our citizens’ jobs and wages. We will protect our people’s homes and communities. And we will defeat the Woke Zealots trying to destroy our country.Here is the critical lesson for the Republican Party: In the face of this dangerously extreme, incompetent, and disdainful political opposition, we should not concede the Radical Democrats a SINGLE VOTER. Their party has declared war on police, war on energy, war on jobs, war on work, war on parents’ rights, war on women’s sports, war on borders, war on the Second Amendment, war on free speech, war on American Culture, and even war on Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Old Glory, and the National Anthem.So do not listen to ANYONE who tells you that the REPUBLICAN Party needs to be “less divisive”—let’s be clear, it is the Radical Left Marxists and Socialists who are DIVISIVE, and it is by DEFEATING their intolerance and aggression that we will UNITE America.The Democrat Party is a house of cards ready to come toppling down. ON THE REPUBLICAN AGENDABut to win the landslide victory that is within our reach, it is not enough just to make the argument. The People don’t just want to see us WIN power, they want to see us USE power.At the first possible chance, the Republican Party should END Joe Biden’s border crisis. It’s very simple: until they end catch-and-release, stop asylum fraud, restore Remain in Mexico, allow ICE and Border Patrol to do their jobs, and finish the wall which could take one month, not a SINGLE Biden political appointee at the White House or the Department of Homeland Security should get paid. NO BORDER, NO PAYCHECK.The opportunities for a new House Republican Majority will be truly endless:You should pass a plan to make China pay trillions of dollars for unleashing the virus.You should pass new tariffs on foreign trade abusers to re-shore our supply chains.You should insist that children be taught that biological sex is determined at birth—there are Men, and there are Women.You should cut off all Justice Department grants to local DA’s who refuse to prosecute shoplifters and other criminals, but are willing to spend millions and millions of dollars to prosecute Republicans who happen to be leading monumentally in the polls.Just as I did in my executive order last year, you should ban Critical Race Theory.You should save America’s Suburbs from Biden’s CRT-inspired housing agenda.You should force the Interior Department to build the National Garden of American Heroes that I announced in my speech at Mount Rushmore—it was going to Tennessee.You should stop all federal taxpayer dollars from going to Big Tech Monopolies.I congratulate Kevin on his announcement that the House GOP will be introducing a Parents’ Bill of Rights. I hope it includes a right for any parent to OPT OUT of the indoctrination and send their child to the public, private, charter, or faith-based school of their CHOICE.These are the kinds of bold ideas House Republicans should RUN on and WIN on.But none of it will matter if we do not do one thing: pass a comprehensive election security overhaul that includes nationwide photo ID, chain of custody protection, signature verification, citizenship confirmation, and importantly, ensuring that every election can be fully and quickly AUDITED. And especially, if you could get it, same day voting. One day, you vote, and the election’s over. We have to make elections UN-RIGGABLE.Remember, we are not the ones trying to undermine American Democracy—we are the ones trying to SAVE American Democracy.We are not a fifty-fifty country. With their policies of open borders, defund the police, destroy the Second Amendment, no energy independence, no voter ID, high taxes, and rampant crime, there are FAR more of us than there are of them. They’re just great at rigging, cheating, and stealing elections.Our movement did not start the culture war—but we are going to WIN it. ON THE DEMOCRAT’S INSANE SPENDING BILLNEVER before has a political majority in Congress shown such contempt for the citizens they serve.The bill includes MASS AMNESTY for millions of illegal aliens. In addition, the bill is ECONOMIC SUICIDE for our manufacturing base, shipping all our jobs to China by massively boosting taxes on manufacturers and punishing businesses that bring jobs back to America. It includes a global minimum tax that makes it impossible for us to outcompete other counties.And the bill is also loaded with toxic Critical Race Theory provisions—they use a different term, “equity,” but it’s the same Marxist ideology, and they want to spend billions of dollars imposing it everywhere they can.This bill will make America weak, poor, divided, and unsafe. We have to get out there EVERY SINGLE DAY and fight it—and the more we fight it, the more seats we will win in 2022. So until that vote, there is only one goal: we must KILL THE BILL, which will set the stage for a political earthquake next year.The bill will reduce the incomes of 80 percent of Americans, cost an estimated $4.5 trillion dollars, and fuel more inflation.The new and ridiculously large Democrat bill gives illegals welfare and government benefits, and free child tax credits. It eliminates caps on Green Cards, allows unlimited chain migration, and grants unlimited numbers of foreign nationals the ability to PURCHASE permanent U.S. residency for just $2,500.It allows the Big Tech giants to replace qualified Americans with cheap foreign workers. It issues diversity visas SPECIFICALLY to the people who were rejected by our Travel Ban because they came from the most dangerous places on earth.It’s the most pro-China bill ever put forward. It will crush retirees and Middle-Class Americans with new taxes on their pensions and retirement accounts.It includes $80 billion dollars to DOUBLE the size of the IRS, with 87,000 new IRS agents to attack you and your family.In the midst of an energy and inflation crisis, the bill raises taxes on American Energy.The bill forces states to use taxpayer-funds to subsidize abortion.And it spends billions of dollars on illegal racial discrimination."

She is happy to join the Democrats in the Unselect Committee (the next RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA Hoax), and spread more of their lies. Cheney is far more unpopular than her father, who just lost his position as the least popular Vice President in American history to Kamala Harris. Democrats would never put up with a Liz Cheney in their ranks. If we had a Free and Fair media, instead of a corrupt media, those election results would never have been allowed to happen.

As anexample take a look at what happened yesterday in Racine, Wisconsin, where a brave Patriot Sheriff and his staff found fraud and criminal activity with regard to what took place with ballot harvesting and other things in nursing homes, which the Wisconsin Election Commission ordered to be done throughout the state. This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many other improprieties in Wisconsin, including numerous laws broken, according to a new report from the Legislative Audit Bureau, who identified at least 44,272 illegal “indefinitely confined” votes who did not show Voter ID. Almost 7% of a sample of mail-in ballots were missing information required by law, and therefore should not have counted, which would amount to 32,431 illegal ballots.  Just one example of fraud in Georgia (and there is so much more!) is enough to swing the election, as 43,907 ballots from Facebook funded drop boxes violated Chain of Custody requirements, and were thus illegally counted? In Michigan, even the RINOs in the state senate confirmed roughly 45,000 ballots were delivered to the TCF Center in Detroit with no Chain of Custody at 3:30 and 4:30 a.m on Nov. 4, and an estimated 289,866 absentee ballots were illegally sent to people who never requested them, far more votes than needed to win the state. Also in Arizona, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors were caught spreading“outright lies” about the Audit, and caught illegally deleting election data and records in defiance of a subpoena. They cannot explain away the findings of the Arizona Audit, which include:  ●      23,344 “Mail-In Ballots Voted from Prior Address”●      9,041 “More Ballots Returned by Voter Than Received”●      284,412 ballot images “were corrupt or missing” ●      17,322 duplicate ballot envelopes (which surged after Election Day)●      5,295 “Voters That Potentially Voted in Multiple Counties”●      2,382 “In-Person Voters Who Had Moved out of Maricopa County”●      2,081 “Voters Moved Out-of-State During 29-Day Period Preceding Election”●      “Official Results Does Not Match Who Voted” (off by at least 3,432 ballots) There is far too much corruption and irregularities in Arizona to put in this letter, so we are attaching a copy of the just released and totally determinative report pertaining to the Election Audit. Not included in the Audit was Pima County, which had multiple precincts with OVER 100 percent turnout for mail-in ballots—which is not possible (or legal!). These alone total 11,994 ballots, more than the election margin. Precincts with anomalous high turnout laughably went from 6% of Republicans voting for Biden to 40% of Republicans“voting” for Biden in mail-in ballots. No one in the Fake News Media pretends to believe this, so they just ignore the facts. It is all just part of the 2020 Presidential Election Scam. We are not talking about one state, Pennsylvania, we are talking about numerous states, far more than is necessary to win, which we did, but which the Fake News media and the Wall Street Journal refused to talk about and are doing everything within their power to cover up. They don’t want the facts because if they had them, we win!  The Wall Street Journal does not properly refute the numbers in Pennsylvania and doesn’t even address the fact that there are still at least 120,000 excess voters not accounted for by the Pennsylvania Department of State, meaning more votes than voters! The thing the Wall Street Journal is right about is the statement that “their attempts to censor Mr. Trump have done nothing to diminish his popularity,” and “our advice would be to examine [the Democrats’] own standards after they fell so easily for false Russian collusion claims.” The only problem is they didn’t fall for it, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary Clinton (with her now indicted lawyer, Michael Sussman, etc.) illegally created the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA and UKRAINE, UKRAINE, UKRAINE scams, Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, and many more. For whatever reason, the Wall Street Journalis doing a complete cover-up of the facts and figures behind the 2020 Presidential Election. After having dealt with them and others in the media for 4 years as president, I have lost complete confidence in them. They don’t want the facts, but the people of our Country, and indeed the world, understand what is going on. I’d like to conclude by thanking all of the millions of wonderful people who are working so hard against the Radical Left Democrats and the Fake News Media in order to show and prove this massive election fraud."

The FORENSIC AUDITORS released a new report that discredits all of the disinformation put out by the RINO Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. The auditors said Maricopa County purposely misled the public and spread “outright lies” about their findings. The Board provided zero evidence for their false claims, including no accounting for the 12,772 illegal ballots (more than the election margin alone) who moved outside of Maricopa County before the election. They have no valid answer for how there were more early ballots returned by voters than received, why their official results did not match who voted, why there were more duplicate ballots than originals, or why they deleted and purged their Election Management System data in defiance of a subpoena, which is against the law, and they did it on the day before the audit began. These incredible findings affect tens of thousands of ballots, and therefore, the outcome of the Election. This does not even touch Pima County, which had precincts with more than 100 percent turnout for mail-in ballots.  The Presidential Election in Arizona (and in numerous states) was a Fraud. Maricopa County officials lied, and then tried to cover it up. Now they are facing criminal liability since defying a subpoena and deleting election records are serious crimes.

He spent four years with me in the White House and in the 2016 Campaign for the Presidency. His narrative is factual and indisputable.

Finally we have a real and inside account of our very successful four years. An incredible read published today. I strongly recommend this important book that will set a historic standard.

2021-10-18,"MEMO: Lawsuit Filed to Defend Executive Privilege, U.S. Constitution",/news/news-mny5zgve9x901,"Today, President Donald J. Trump filed a lawsuit in defense of the Constitution, the Office of the President, and the future of our nation, all of which the sham Unselect Committee is trying to destroy. The fact is America is under assault by Pelosi’s Communist-style attempt to silence and destroy America First patriots through this hyper-partisan and illegitimate investigation. ●      The January 6th Committee is a partisan sham to distract Americans from the Democrats’ policies that are killing and robbing Americans. For example: o   The Border crisis is flooding our communities with drugs and gangs, while costing taxpayers billions.o   The Democrats' mismanagement of COVID exposed America’s elderly to a deadly disease and then in many cases, forced them to die alone.o   By defunding the police and embracing criminals, Democrats have made our cities less safe.o   The unconstitutional mandates are destroying the economy. ●      The media is complicit in advancing the Committee’s unconstitutionally flawed request. ●      This committee exposed itself as a sham by requesting documents which serve no legitimate legislative purpose—what does President Trump's campaign polling data from Florida have to do with an investigation into January 6th? The Legal Argument—Three Pillars No Legitimate Legislative Purpose:The legislative committees’ request fails to meet the basic requirement of fulfilling a legislative purpose. The request is not just overly broad, it requests documents including campaign polling data—what does Congress hope to learn from this?Newsflash: Polling shows Biden’s approval cratering and 2022 slipping out of Democrats’ grasp—no wonder the Democrats and the media want to distract America from: The surrender in Afghanistan, skyrocketing inflation, a border crisis, crippling COVID mandates, and a stalled legislative agenda. Former Presidents have inherent Constitutional Rights of Privilege: An incumbent administration does not have the constitutional authority to unilaterally waive the executive privilege of a previous administration—especially one so recent.  If it did, then executive privilege doesn’t exist, including for Joe Biden. Newsflash: No one is following this argument more closely than: (1) Hunter Biden and his art dealer, (2) The Woke Generals and Intel leaders who advised the Surrender in Afghanistan and the bombing of innocent civilians and children (3) Big Tech who has been actively engaged with the Biden administration to subvert Democracy through dark money organizations Time for Review:The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has not even had the time to compile and organize the documents being requested by Congress—which is the largest request in American History. President Trump and Joe Biden should be afforded the time to diligently review any protected and privileged documents before it is released to the public. Newsflash: The Committee is motivated by one thing: delivering political wins for the Democrats. That’s why they’ve set a rapid timetable that steamrolls the Constitution, legal precedent, and established process. The Committee isn’t seeking the truth, it’s seeking Communist-style political persecution of President Trump and the America First patriots who served their country honorably. Taylor BudowichDirector of CommunicationsPresident Donald J.

2021-10-18,Statement Regarding Today’s Deposition of President Donald J. Trump,/news/news-ff2ztwvv3e902,"“The Klu Klux Klan dressed protester case should have never been brought as the plaintiffs have no one to blame but themselves. Rather than protest peacefully, the plaintiffs intentionally sought to rile up a crowd by blocking the entrance to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue, in the middle of the day, wearing Klu Klux Klan robes and hoods. When security tried to deescalate the situation, they were unfortunately met with taunts and violence from the plaintiffs themselves. Seeing this for what it is, prior to my deposition today, the Court dismissed almost all of the plaintiffs’ claims—except for a baseless claim for injuries they never suffered, and the temporary loss of a worthless cardboard sign which was soon thereafter returned to them.  After years of litigation, I was pleased to have had the opportunity to tell my side of this ridiculous story—Just one more example of baseless harassment of your favorite President.” — Donald J.

2021-10-15,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-nubcfjnkrb882,"A new analysis of mail-in ballots in Pima County, Arizona means the election was Rigged and Stolen from the Republican Party in 2020, and in particular, its Presidential Candidate. This analysis, derived from publicly available election data, shows staggering anomalies and fictitious votes in Pima County’s mail-in returns, making it clear they stuffed the ballot box (in some precincts with more ballots than were ever sent!).  Your favorite Republican candidate was steadily outperforming the Republican share of mail-in ballots by 3%, while Joe Biden was underperforming Democrats by 3%. But when mail-in ballots started pouring in way higher than normal (at over 87%), this trend flipped. In other words, when it was clear Trump was going to win, that’s when they swung into action. As more mail-in ballots poured in and increased by 1%, Trump’s performance decreased by 1%, while Biden’s increased.  As more and more mail-in ballots were stuffed into the system, Biden’s numbers shot way up. But they overplayed their hand, and got caught. Two precincts in Pima had over 100 percent turnout for mail-in ballots -- which is impossible -- and 40 precincts had over 97% returned. The national mail-in ballot return rate was 71%, but in Pima County the mail-in ballot return rate was 15% higher, and 19% higher than all the counties combined in the entire state of Arizona. One precinct with 99.5% mail-in turnout had 9,812 ballots counted. Another precinct with 100.6% turnout had 2,182 ballots returned, but only 2,170 mail-ins were ever sent. These two total 11,994 ballots, alone more than the margin needed to win.   Turnout rates of 99% and 100% is what you get in a Third World Country, and that’s what we’re becoming (look at crime, the Border, Afghanistan, food prices, energy prices, and the empty store shelves, etc.), unless this is fixed immediately!  The precincts above 92% mail-in return rate represented 264,000 votes. If just 2% are fraudulent, meaning Trump votes went to Biden, that would be enough to change the so-called margin in Arizona of 10,457 votes. The Department of Justice has had this information since the November 2020 Election, and has done nothing about it. The Pima County GOP should start a canvass of Republican voters, in order to identify and remove the obvious fictitious voters from the system. In addition, the Arizona Audit found tens of thousands of illegal votes, including 6,545 mail-in ballots with no envelopes, 2,580 bad signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes, and 1,919 mail-in ballot envelopes with no signature, which is also determinative and more than the margin. Either a new Election should immediately take place or the past Election should be decertified and the Republican candidate declared the winner.  "

Congressman Andrew Clyde exposed the Democrats' ""Big Lie"" that Biden ""won"" the recount, because no matter how many times you count counterfeit money, ""you may have 100 pieces of paper in your pocket, but you sure don't have $100 dollars in legal tender.""The hearing exposed how numerous laws were broken during the Arizona voting, how blank mail-in ballot envelopes were approved, and how there are tens of thousands of suspected fraudulent ballots. The Fake News, however, refuses to cover those questions and answers because they prove, without question, that we won Arizona (and many other states)."

This Committee's fake investigation is not about January 6th any more than the Russia Hoax was about Russia. Instead, this is about using the power of the government to silence ""Trump"" and our Make America Great Again movement, the greatest such achievement of all time. We won two elections, did far better in the second than the first, and now perhaps have to do it a third time! It is also about trying to deflect blame from Biden's surrender in Afghanistan and the failures to address COVID, the border, crime, and the economy that is leaving Americans dead or broke. It's another grand distraction, because Biden and the Democrats don't want you to see how badly America is losing due to their incompetence. My administration, and the great patriots who worked on behalf of the American people, will not be intimidated. We will not allow Biden or the Radical Democrats to get off without accepting blame for their incompetence and failures. I will always fight for America First, and the Constitution.

That’s why I know he will hold the line on raising taxes and demand accountability from Hialeah City Hall.   I also have no doubt that Steve will stand-up to the far-left agenda that looks to change America.  Steve, like so many families in Hialeah, knows how socialism destroys a country from within with policies that give government way too much power over our lives. When it comes to supporting our brave First Responders, Bovo has been front and center. That’s why the Police Benevolent Association, the Fraternal Order of Police and Hialeah Firefighters are all backing him.  The great people of Hialeah understand the importance of electing good candidates to local government that will stop the social experiments of the extremists and their reckless tax and spend agenda that’s crippling communities and killing jobs. As Mayor, Bovo will fight for the values that are now under attack by the Radical Left.  That’s why I’m asking the amazing people of Hialeah to join me in this fight by supporting Esteban “Steve” Bovo for Mayor of Hialeah.

Then she acted like she was a know-it-all, but in reality, she had no influence whatsoever. She was very close to one of the dumbest and most “crazed” people in Washington, John Bolton.

2021-10-04,USMCA Update from Bob Lighthizer,/news/news-69bgqknmxw799,"""Until recently, US auto companies sourced nearly all of their batteries overseas. USMCA changed that. Under the agreement, an automobile cannot qualify for duty free treatment unless 40 percent of the content (45 for a truck) is manufactured by workers earning at least $16 per hour.  Advanced batteries of the kind that will power new energy vehicles comprise such a high percentage of the value of these vehicles that it will be almost impossible for auto companies to qualify them under the agreement without sourcing the batteries in the United States. And in order to take advantage of a longer transition time available under the agreement, most auto companies have committed to qualifying their entire North American fleet—regardless of where the vehicles are manufactured and traded.The result we are seeing is a Renaissance in US battery production.  SK Innovations announced a $2.6 billion new facility in Georgia that will open later this year. And just yesterday SK and Ford announced an $11 billion investment in Tennessee and Kentucky.  Without USMCA—and the Trump Administration’s strong actions to push back against China’s unfair trade practices—this new investment and the thousands of good paying jobs that go with it would have gone to China or other low wage jurisdictions.  Worker-focused trade policy works for America.  More of America’s cars of the future will be built right here."""

2021-10-03,Letter to the Pulitzer Prizes,/news/news-ctrqtajxua797,"Re:       Demand for Revocation of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting Dear Mr. Kliment: I call on the Pulitzer Prize Board to immediately rescind the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting awarded to the staffs of The New York Times and The Washington Post, which was based on false reporting of a non-existent link between the Kremlin and the Trump Campaign.  As has been widely publicized, the coverage was no more than a politically motivated farce which attempted to spin a false narrative that my campaign supposedly colluded with Russia despite a complete lack of evidence underpinning this allegation. When the Board announced the prize, it lauded the recipients “for deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nations’ understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team, and his eventual administration.” Specifically, the prize was awarded for a series of articles centered around the now-debunked Russia collusion conspiracy theory. The headlines themselves were extremely sensational and leaned heavily on unsubstantiated anonymous sources. For example, much of the information contained in these articles were credited to “people with knowledge,” “current and former officials,” “some senior U.S. officials,” and other vaguely defined individuals. As a result, the public was deprived of an independent means of assessing their credibility, their potential for political bias, and the source of their knowledge. For two years, these institutions feverishly pushed one Russia story after another and – despite lacking any credible evidence – attempted to persuade the public that my campaign had colluded with the Russian government.  Contemporaneously with that reporting, numerous conservative news outlets and commentators questioned the legitimacy of these reports, exposing the clear logical fallacies contained in their narratives and pointing to the clear lack of evidence underpinning them.  It has since been confirmed that the allegations were false and I have been exonerated of these charges. Most recently, John Durham’s indictment of former cybersecurity attorney and Hillary Clinton Campaign attorney, Michael Sussman, serves as a damning repudiation of the media’s obsession with the collusion story. The indictment pointedly accuses Mr. Sussman of making false statements to the FBI when he presented “evidence” purporting to show secret communications between my organization and the Russia-based Alfa Bank. At the time, Mr. Sussman assured the FBI that he was providing this information of his own accord, and not at the behest of any particular individual or entity. The indictment reveals, however, that Mr. Sussman was working with other Democrats and billing his time to the Clinton campaign. Importantly, the indictment reinforces the falsehood of the Alfa Bank connection, stating that “the FBI’s investigation revealed that the e-mail server at issue was not owned or operated by the Trump Organization but, rather, had been administered by a mass marketing email company that send advertisements for Trump hotels and hundreds of other clients.”  For over a century, the Pulitzer Prize has been widely recognized as a significant  achievement in the field of journalism. It has been viewed by many as an honor that is meant to be bestowed upon well-deserving recipients in recognition of their groundbreaking journalistic efforts. This level of reverence carries with it a very important connotation, namely that the reporting itself is inherently deemed credible, well-sourced and trustworthy. Given this powerful presumption, there is a heavy burden to ensure that these works are continuously and closely examined as to the veracity of the information contained therein. When it becomes apparent that a Pulitzer Prize-winning work was based on shoddy, dubious and manifestly false reporting – as is the case here – the Pulitzer Prize Board must react accordingly.  Ultimately, my hope is that the recipients of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, The New York Times and The Washington Post, will voluntarily surrender this award in light of recent revelations. However, should they fail to do so, I would expect that you will take the necessary steps to rectify the situation, including stripping the recipients of their prize and retracting the false statements which remain on the Pulitzer website. Without holding the recipients to such a high standard of accountability, the integrity of the Pulitzer Prize namesake stands to be wholly compromised.                                                                         Sincerely,                                                                         Donald J. Trump "

But these terrible assaults will just be the tip of the iceberg of what’s coming if this isn’t shut down. The CR even covers people who don’t live in Afghanistan and haven’t in many years, as long as they used to live there.

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-pfkrfrvz8k772,"Just eight months ago, the whole world knew that if you illegally violated America’s borders, no matter where you came from, you’d be immediately caught, promptly detained, and swiftly removed—perfect precision clockwork. Our border was the envy of nations. Now, our border is the laughingstock of the globe. Anyone, from anywhere, can just illegally walk across our border, turn themselves in, and then be on to the city of their choice. No testing, no masking, no mandates. Free healthcare, deliveries, and medical services in our emergency rooms, all paid for by taxpayers. Drugs pour through like water. Our border agents are disrespected, denigrated, and demoralized.  Now, news reports indicate another 20,000 Haitians are staged in Columbia preparing to make the trek to our Southern Border. But that’s just the beginning. Wave after wave are heading our way, INVITED here to break our laws by Biden, Mayorkas, and the Marxist Democrats. Indeed, at this very moment, House Democrats are preparing to pass a Reconciliation Bill that includes total amnesty for millions of illegal aliens, and removes all limits on green cards and chain migration. Democrats are playing for keeps—Republicans better fight hard, fight strong, and stay united for America, or we won’t have a Country left."

2021-09-24,The Truth About the Arizona Audit,/news/news-pktxnejtwn770,"Read the full report here.  From the Maricopa County Forensic Election Audit Volume I: Executive Summary & Recommendations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The preamble to our Constitution reminds us that our nation is always pursuing greater perfection, seeking to establish “... a more perfect Union” so that we can “...secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” Nothing is more essential in preserving liberty than free and fair elections. To that end, Cyber Ninjas was engaged by the Arizona Senate to audit the 2020 General Election and determine in what areas legislative reform may enhance our current process so that our elections may continue to get better, becoming “more perfect.” In doing so, it was our goal to improve confidence in American elections by identifying areas where legislation could resolve any identified issues.This audit has been the most comprehensive and complex election audit ever conducted. It involved the hand counting of 2.1 million ballots, a forensic paper inspection of all ballots, a forensic review of the voting machines, and an in-depth analysis of the voter rolls and the 2020 General Election final files.What has been found is both encouraging and revealing. On the positive side there were no substantial differences between the hand count of the ballots provided and the official election canvass results for Maricopa County. This is an important finding because the paper ballots are the best evidence of voter intent and there is no reliable evidence that the paper ballots were altered to any material degree.Based on our other findings, however, we recommend that the Legislature tighten up the election process to provide additional certainty going forward, and that several specific findings of our audit be further reviewed by the Arizona Attorney General for a possible investigation. Such other findings include the following:None of the various systems related to elections had numbers that would balance and agree with each other. In some cases, these differences were significant.There appears to be many 27, 807 ballots cast from individuals who had moved prior to the election.Files were missing from the Election Management System (EMS) Server.Ballot images 284,412 on the EMS were corrupt or missing.Logs appeared to be intentionally rolled over, and all the data in the database related to the 2020 General Election had been fully cleared.On the ballot side, batches were not always clearly delineated, duplicated ballots were missing the required serial numbers, originals were duplicated more than once, and the Auditors were never provided Chain-of- Custody documentation for the ballots for the time-period prior to the ballot’s movement into the Auditors’ care. This all increased the complexity and difficulty in properly auditing the results; and added ambiguity into the final conclusions.Maricopa County failed to follow basic cyber security best practices and guidelines from CISASoftware and patch protocols were not followedCredential management was flawed: unique usernames and passwords were not allocatedLack of baseline for host and network activity for approved programs, communications protocols and communications devices for voting systems"

The number includes 23,344 mail-in ballots, despite the person no longer living at that address. Phantom voters! The official canvass does not even match who voted, off by 11,592—more than the entire Presidential Election margin. Voters who voted in multiple counties totaled 10,342, and 2,382 ballots came from people who no longer lived in Maricopa County. There were also 2,592 ""more duplicate ballots than original ballots."" Just those fraudulent ballots alone total 50,252, and is fraud many more times than the so-called margin of “victory,” which was only 10,457. In addition, election data appears to have been intentionally deleted, and ballot images were “corrupt or missing.” This is not even the whole state of Arizona, but only Maricopa County.

2021-09-23,Letter to Texas Governor Greg Abbott,/news/news-ymx67zmgvg748,"Dear Governor Abbott, Despite my big win in Texas, I hear Texans want an election audit! You know your fellow Texans have big questions about the November 2020 Election. Bills to audit elections in your great state's House and Senate were considered during Texas' Second Special Session. Instead, the legislature passed a watered-down amendment that doesn’t even apply to the 2020 Presidential Election. This short amendment doesn't answer the questions Texans have about the last election. Texans demand a real audit to completely address their concerns. We need HB 16, which was just filed in the Third Special Session. This legislation specifically addresses the 2020 Presidential Election, and enables audits for future elections. The bill creates a process for candidates and party chairs to initiate an audit, and uses the same language as SB 97, which already passed the Texas State Senate, but did not have enough time to make it through the House during the Second Special Session. Texas needs you to act now. Your Third Special Session is the perfect, and maybe last, opportunity to pass this audit bill. Time is running out. Paper ballots in your state are only kept for 22 months after the election. Your citizens don’t trust the election system, and they want your leadership on this issue, which is the number one thing they care about. It is their most important issue—one that will affect 2022 and 2024.  Governor Abbott, we need a ""Forensic Audit of the 2020 Election"" added to the call. We're quickly running out of time and it must be done this week. Texans know voting fraud occurred in some of their counties. Let's get to the bottom of the 2020 Presidential Election Scam! Donald J. Trump"

Look at the facts that are coming out in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and other States. If this were Schumer and the Democrats, with the evidence we have of Election Fraud (especially newly revealed evidence), they would have never voted to approve Biden as President, and had they not, all of the mistakes that were made over the last month, which are destroying our Country, would not have happened. Mike Lee, Lindsey Graham, and all of the other Republicans who were unwilling to fight for the Presidency of the United States, which would have included at least an additional four Republican Senators, two in Georgia, one in Michigan, one in Arizona, are letting the Democrats get away with the greatest Election Hoax in history—a total con job! We are losing our Country! The Democrats are vicious and fight like hell, and the Republicans do nothing about it. RINOs fight harder against Republicans than they do against Democrats.

He wouldn’t, they didn’t talk for years. I didn’t know Scooter, but gave him a full pardon—not at their request, but because he deserved it. He suffered greatly.

Before me, they never gave us “ten cents.” For Lightweight General Mark Milley to have called the Chinese to “bring down the temperature” of my negotiations with them, negotiations that were having a major positive impact on large-scale benefits to the United States, is outrageous. We were not going to make any Military moves—never even thought of it, but we were hitting them so hard in all other ways. While every other President caved to China, China was caving to me and the U.S. for the first time ever. “Dumbo” Milley inserted himself right in the middle of my trade negotiation, and if he did what is reported, he would have had a profound negative effect on those negotiations. Milley is an idiot with no common sense or ability to negotiate—that’s why he left $85 Billion of the World’s best Military equipment in the hands of the Taliban for no reason whatsoever. That’s also why 13 young Warriors are not with their families tonight.

Actions should be taken immediately against Milley, and better generals in our Military, of which we have many, should get involved so that another Afghanistan disaster never happens again. Remember, I was the one who took out 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. Milley said it couldn’t be done!  For the record, I never even thought of attacking China—and China knows that.

We are no longer respected after the pathetic and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. It will be a long time before we gain our reputation back. Just nine months ago, the United States was viewed as being strong, and now we are being viewed as weak and stupid. The Taliban has totally retaken Afghanistan—a far more potent position than they had 20 years ago, after we spent trillions of dollars, with hundreds of thousands of lives lost (on both sides). This loss emboldens not only foreign terrorists, but also Antifa and BLM. It’s sad that this is not what you hear from the Fake News Media who are only interested in talking about “terrorism” from the right and protecting an illegitimate president.

2021-09-11,Remarks by 45th President Donald J. Trump at the Let Us Worship “Day of Prayer for America”,/news/news-pswzw2nzcg690,"It is an absolutely profound honor to address all of you gathered on the National Mall on this very solemn day of remembrance and prayer, as our Nation commemorates the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a terrible day. I want to thank Sean Feucht and everyone from the amazing Let Us Worship movement for hosting this very beautiful and incredible event. Since last year, you have brought worship and prayer to 132 cities all across the Country—including the largest church service in America right here in our Nation's capital. By uniting citizens of all denominations and backgrounds to promote faith and freedom in America, you are strengthening our entire Nation and we thank you for it. There could be no more fitting night for Americans to join hands and bow our heads in prayer than this evening. Two decades after nearly 3,000 Americans were murdered at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Western Pennsylvania, we honor the memory of every innocent soul killed in the September 11 attacks. We cherish their legacy, and we reaffirm our everlasting vow to Never Forget. We all remember hearing in the hours and days after the attacks the stories of Police Officers, Firefighters, and First Responders who showed bravery and daring far beyond the call of duty. As a lifelong New Yorker, it was extraordinary to witness the strength and resilience of people of that incredible city, and it is indeed an incredible city. They raced into danger, toward the smoke, without a thought of their own safety. The heroism of the NYPD, the FDNY, the Port Authority Police, as well as the First Responders at the Pentagon, and so many others will live in our national memory for all time. Tonight, I want to express our thanks to every First Responder present on the National Mall. You are the very best of our Nation. You are incredible people. I also want to ask every American here today, and all across the Country, to take a moment to share our gratitude for the countless people—active duty Service Members, Veterans, and Military families—who have sacrificed to defend our Country over the past two decades. And let’s especially be thanking and thinking of the brave heroes who served in Afghanistan. They courageously volunteered to hunt down the vile killers who attacked America, and to eliminate the menace of Radical Islamic Terrorism from the face of the earth. And I know what you are thinking because we have suffered a great, great embarrassment over the last week. A terrible thing has happened, terrible decisions were made by this administration. But you are brave, you are incredible, and it will be made up.   Earlier today, members of the Let Us Worship Movement placed flags on the graves of every Service Member in Arlington Cemetery who gave their life for our Nation since September 11. To the Gold Star families present on the Mall, and to the families of all the Service Members who have made the supreme sacrifice in our fight against the terrorist enemy, please know that you have our undying loyalty, our eternal devotion, and the love and support of every single American. As we pray and reflect on this anniversary, one story from that terrible day points the way forward for our Nation and reminds us of the infinite source of our hope. As black smoke was billowing from across the Potomac at the Pentagon and the skies of New York were full of ash and flame, a lone figure stood at a window near the base of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Father Mychal Judge was the chaplain of a New York City fire station. When the first plane struck the World Trade Center, he raced inside knowing the danger. Video testimony shows him standing still at the large window, looking up at people falling to their deaths. A friend and fellow priest later recounted that if you watch carefully, you can see the Father's lips moving. ""For those of us who know him,"" the friend said, ""he wasn't one that talked to himself. He was praying.”   Moments later, the South Tower collapsed, and the implosion shattered the glass window and killed Father Mike. The day before he died, Father Mike spoke at the dedication of a New York City fire station. Before a group of firefighters, he shared a message that echoes across all time. “You do what God called you to do,” he told them. “You show up. You put one foot in front of the other. You get on the rig and go out and you do the job, which is a mystery. You have no idea what God has calling for you.” You have no idea where you’re going, and in some cases you don’t know why. “But he needs you. He needs me. He needs all of us.” Tonight, Father Mike's words remind us that in the end, there is only one true answer to the depth and the evil that we saw on September 11, 2001. It is God.  That is the answer that stood tall over the wreckage at Ground Zero, where rescuers forged the mighty steel cross from the fallen towers' broken beams. It is the same sight that was seen hundreds of miles away in Shanksville—where the first, spontaneous memorial to the heroes of Flight 93 was a simple, but beautiful, wooden cross. And it is this same turning to God—the ultimate answer to evil—that we see here today, as thousands of Americans gather on the mall to pray for our beloved Nation and to pray for one another. I want to thank Let Us Worship for calling Americans to 21 days of prayer in the coming weeks. America is a Nation strengthened and sustained by God and the prayers of all His children. Your faith is a force that our enemies can never ever extinguish. Your love of God, Family, and Country is more powerful than any adversary's hatred, or malice, or scorn. So as we remember those Americans we lost two decades ago, we return again and again to the same simple prayer that was heard echoing all across our land in the days after the September 11 attacks: God Bless Our First Responders. God Bless Our Service Members. God Bless the memory of all who died on 9/11. And God Bless America. Thank You."

The job they did was truly unbelievable. We love them, and we thank them. It is also a sad time for the way our war on those that did such harm to our Country ended last week. The loss of 13 great warriors and the many more who were wounded should never have happened. Overall, 250 people were killed in Afghanistan last week and so many more were seriously injured. We had $85 billion of the finest and most sophisticated military equipment taken from us without even a shot being fired. The leader of our Country was made to look like a fool and that can never be allowed to happen. It was caused by bad planning, incredible weakness, and leaders who truly didn’t understand what was happening. This is the 20th year of this war and should have been a year of victory, honor, and strength.

To add insult to injury, those who support this “taking” now plan to cut it into three pieces, and throw this work of art into storage prior to its complete desecration.  Robert E. Lee is considered by many Generals to be the greatest strategist of them all. President Lincoln wanted him to command the North, in which case the war would have been over in one day. Robert E. Lee instead chose the other side because of his great love of Virginia, and except for Gettysburg, would have won the war. He should be remembered as perhaps the greatest unifying force after the war was over, ardent in his resolve to bring the North and South together through many means of reconciliation and imploring his soldiers to do their duty in becoming good citizens of this Country.  Our culture is being destroyed and our history and heritage, both good and bad, are being extinguished by the Radical Left, and we can’t let that happen!

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-zergawxs9n657,"The only reason Senator “Gloomy” Pat Toomey is not running for the Senate in Pennsylvania is that I would not give him an endorsement—I feel he has been a terrible representative for both Pennsylvania and the United States, as a whole. His views on Tariffs and so-called Free Trade (where other nations take total advantage of the United States), are archaic. He ran with me in 2016 and wasn’t expected to win, but because of my victory he did. He still doesn’t realize what happened, and why—not the sharpest tool in the shed. Fortunately for Pennsylvania, we have a great Senate candidate, Sean Parnell, who I have just given my Complete and Total Endorsement. He will do all of the things that Toomey is incapable of doing. Sean Parnell will represent the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania the way it should be represented—and it’s about time! "

If Mitch McConnell was smart, which we’ve seen no evidence of, he would use the debt ceiling card to negotiate a good infrastructure package.  This is a 2,700 page bill that no one could have possibly read—they would have needed to take speed reading courses. It is a gift to the Democrat Party, compliments of Mitch McConnell and some RINOs, who have no idea what they are doing. There is very little on infrastructure in all of those pages. Instead, they track your driving so they can tax you. It is Joe Biden’s form of a gas tax but far bigger, far higher and, mark my words, far worse. They want to track you everywhere you go and watch everything you do! Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill will be used against the Republican Party in the upcoming elections in 2022 and 2024. It will be very hard for me to endorse anyone foolish enough to vote in favor of this deal.  The good news is that the progressive wing in the Democrat Party will lose all credibility with this approval. Additionally, Kevin McCarthy and Republican House members seem to be against the bill. If it can’t be killed in the Senate, maybe it dies in the House! Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats understand that this is the way to get the horrendous $3.5 trillion, actually $5 trillion, Green New Deal bill done in the House. Mitch is playing right into Nancy’s hands, not to mention the fact Chuck Schumer is already going around saying this is a big victory for the Democrats. Whether it’s the House or the Senate, think twice before you approve this terrible deal. Republicans should wait until after the Midterms when they will gain all the strength they’ll need to make a good deal, but remember, you already have the card, it’s called the debt ceiling, which the Democrats threatened us with constantly."

Hopefully, people will NEVER FORGET!"
2021-08-01,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-qvb8wmvsyn0,"The New York Times, and others, always insert a clause into their stories, “WITHOUT EVIDENCE, that the election was decided fraudulently.” As usual, this is FAKE NEWS.  There is massive and unconditional evidence that the election was shattered with fraud and irregularities at a level that our Country has never seen before. Much of it is already public, and a great deal more is coming out in the very near future. Every time you read a statement that there is “no evidence of election fraud,” about the 2020 election scam, just attribute that statement to a crooked and collusive media (they work closely together with the Radical Left Democrats) that will do anything to hide the real facts of this election fiasco.  After seeing the irrefutable evidence from numerous states, others are talking about doing deep forensic audits. This election was a scam, and the Lamestream Media is doing everything in their power not to allow the people to see or read about what really took place. We no longer have a free and open media (they don’t cover the truth), but the word is getting out stronger than ever before. Even the Justice Department has no interest in the crooked and corrupt 2020 Presidential Election. They are only interested in hurting those who want to reveal how totally dishonest it was. The Justice Department should be looking at the people who rigged the election, not the Patriots of our Country who are seeking to find how our Nation was defrauded.We must also look to the future and fight for State Legislatures to reform their elections so that this will NEVER happen again. In the end, truth will WIN! Contribute to Save America and DonaldJTrump.com in order to keep continuing this fight."

The committees have approximately $102 Million cash on hand.These fundraising numbers, coupled with tremendous support in so many other ways, show that President Trump's supporters want him to continue the fight for the America First Agenda and the truth in the 2020 elections. Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our constitutional republic. “Bringing the truth about the Rigged and Stolen 2020 election to light is critical to restoring faith in our election process and our country itself. On behalf of the millions of men and women who share my outrage and want me to continue to fight for the truth, I am grateful for your support. And I can’t imagine a more important time to elect good Republicans to the House and Senate. Commonsense conservatives were never more badly needed. We must have people who will stand for our America First Agenda of lower taxes, fewer regulations, support the Second Amendment, strong Borders, honoring our vets, and are very tough on crime. The American people know what’s at stake,” said President Donald J. Trump.""I will never stop fighting for Free and Fair elections, and to elect the right candidates,"" said President Trump.The entities filed with the Federal Election Commission today for the reporting period of 1/1/21 through 6/30/21.

The documents were meant to uphold the integrity and honesty of elections and the sanctity of our vote. The American People want, and demand, that the President of the United States, its chief law enforcement officer in the country, stand with them to fight for Election Integrity and to investigate attempts to undermine our nation. Our country has just suffered an incredibly corrupt Presidential Election, and it is time for Congress and others to investigate how such corruption was allowed to take place rather than investigating those that are exposing this massive fraud on the American People."

Once they pass this bill out of the Senate, it will sit in the House until they get steamrolled by the biggest government expansion in a generation. Tax increases on everyone, government run health care, more government run schools, amnesty for illegal immigrants, MASKS, and many more terrible socialist programs. Nancy Pelosi has said NO INFRASTRUCTURE until they get everything else. Infrastructure is just a “carrot” for a massive socialist expansion. Why are RINOs so desperate to push bad, Radical Leftist policies? And at the same time give a big win to the Democrats. They will be forced to give up some of the incredible tax cuts gotten during the Trump Administration, one of its many hallmarks. This is bad legislation and politically irresponsible. The Democrats will use it to show they can get anything they want from the Republicans. "

It is a loser for the USA, a terrible deal, and makes the Republicans look weak, foolish, and dumb. It shouldn’t be done.

Democrats are now suggesting that budget reconciliation can be used to pass Mail-In Ballot legislation as well as trying to include Amnesty in their infrastructure package. The infrastructure package has little to do with infrastructure as we know it, bridges, roads, tunnels, etc., but is a dramatic expansion of Government that will cost much more than the $3.5 trillion being discussed. Don’t let this happen! If Amnesty is included in the infrastructure package, there will be a run on our Southern Border the likes of which we have never seen before. It will be a signal that says ""come to America now, because you will soon be a citizen."" Providing Amnesty to illegal aliens, in the history of what already is considered the greatest Border catastrophe, will result in disaster beyond our gravest nightmares. No country can pay this price. Will lead to ruination! Any effort to dictate national Mail-In Voting will be a disaster for our Country and for conservatism. There will never be a Republican elected to high office again.

The writings within these third-rate books are Fake News, and ""General"" Milley (who Mattis wanted to send to Europe in order to get rid of him), if he said what was reported, perhaps should be impeached, or court-martialed and tried. Never once did I have a discussion with him about bringing in the Military, or a ""coup,"" which makes sense, because I lost total confidence in him and the way he handled himself on our little walk to the church. He tries to be a tough guy, which he is not, but he choked beyond belief as soon as a microphone was stuffed in front of his face or, at the mere sight of the Fake News Media. So, there was no talk of a coup, there was no coup, it all never happened, and it’s just a waste of words by fake writers and a General who didn’t have a clue. What there was, was a Rigged and Stolen election, and those facts have come out, and are coming out, loud and clear. Because of the Rigged Election, our Country will suffer like perhaps never before with open Borders, Crime, and Inflation, which will eat everyone alive!"

While this, according to the Senate, is preliminary, with results being announced at a later date, it seems that 74,243 Mail-In Ballots were counted with “no clear record of them being sent.” There were 18,000 voters who were scrubbed from the voter rolls AFTER the election. They also revealed that the voting system was breached or hacked (by who?). Very big printer and ballot problems with different paper used, etc., and MUCH MORE.  The irregularities revealed at the hearing today amount to hundreds of thousands of votes or, many times what is necessary for us to have won. Despite these massive numbers, this is the State that Fox News called early for a Biden victory. There was no victory here, or in any other of the Swing States either.  Maricopa County refuses to work together with the Senate and others who are merely looking for honesty, integrity, and transparency. Why do the Commissioners not want to look into this corrupted election? What are they trying to hide? The highly respected State Senator Wendy Rogers said in a tweet the hearing today means we must decertify the election. In any event, the Senate patriots are moving forward with final results to be announced in the not-too-distant future, but based on today’s hearing, why even wait?"

So ridiculous! Sorry to inform you, but an Election is my form of ""coup,"" and if I was going to do a coup, one of the last people I would want to do it with is General Mark Milley. He got his job only because the world’s most overrated general, James Mattis, could not stand him, had no respect for him, and would not recommend him. To me the fact that Mattis didn’t like him, just like Obama didn’t like him and actually fired Milley, was a good thing, not a bad thing. I often act counter to people's advice who I don’t respect.   In any event, I lost respect for Milley when we walked together to St. John’s Church (which was still smoldering from a Radical Left fire set the day before), side by side, a walk that has now been proven to be totally appropriate—and the following day Milley choked like a dog in front of the Fake News when they told him they thought he should not have been walking with the President, which turned out to be incorrect. He apologized profusely, making it a big story, instead of saying I am proud to walk with and protect the President of the United States. Had he said that, it would have all been over, no big deal, but I saw at that moment he had no courage or skill, certainly not the type of person I would be talking “coup” with. I’m not into coups!   In fact, around the same time Milley, in a conversation, was an advocate of changing all of the names of our Military Forts and Bases.  I realized then, also, he was a much different person than I had hoped. I said to him, “spend more time thinking about China and Russia, and less time on being politically correct.”  But never during my Administration did Milley display what he is showing now. He was not “woke.”  Actually, I don’t believe he ever was, but the way I look at Milley, he’s just a better politician than a general, trying to curry favor with the Radical Left and the absolute crazy people espousing a philosophy which will destroy our Country! "

The hand recount in Fulton County was a total fraud! They stuffed the ballot box—and got caught. We will lose our Country if this is allowed to stand. According to the just released report from Garland Favorito and the highly respected Voter GA, in Fulton County the hand recount was wrong by 60%; 100,000 tally sheets for ballots were missing; they duplicated thousands of extra votes for Joe Biden; and fabricated vote counts of 100–0 for Biden, many times! Ballot batch sheets fraudulently showed multiple unanimous 100–0 counts for Biden, as well as 150–0, and 200–0. Are we now in a Third World country? What else will they find once the full Forensic Audit takes place? This means Brad Raffensperger certified the 2020 Presidential Election Scam despite it being “riddled with massive errors and provable fraud.” This proves what Suzi Voyles, who worked Fulton elections for decades, suspected, that fraudulent photocopied ballots were counted for Biden. This is on top of the 35,000 illegal votes recently found in Georgia, and the over 100,000 obsolete voter registrations, plus thousands of dead people, deleted AFTER the election. Will the Attorney General of Georgia Chris Carr finally act? How has Governor Brian Kemp allowed this to happen? This is corruption at the highest level.

Philadelphia was a cesspool of corruption, which will soon be revealed by the audit. Why are they so concerned that a President, who never goes anywhere, would hop onto beautiful Air Force One and head to Philadelphia if it were an honest election? Why not let the audit go forward and make everybody, on both sides, happy? The results will be the results. But they know it was not an honest election, Philadelphia was one of the most corrupt cities in the Country—and so is Detroit, and so is Milwaukee, and so is Atlanta, and Pittsburgh, and Oakland, and Baltimore. Corruption has gone on for years, but in the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, with the mail-in ballots and the use of Covid to cheat, corruption reached new levels. Remember the poll watchers being thrown out, the windows being sealed so nobody could look in, the ballot drops, and all of the other events that took place that changed so rapidly the Big Trump Win on election night.  Joe should say go forward with this, with all of these audits. His visit is a joke. He doesn’t need to visit, all he needs to do is let them do an audit and find out what happened. Who knows, maybe they’ll say the election was on the up and up, but many people would be shocked. Let the audit go forward like it is in Arizona, despite 107 Democrat lawyers trying to stop it and failing.  Let the Forensic Audit go, Joe. Don’t fight it. Show them how honest it was."

The Radical left writers say this nonsense over and over again, and so does the Fake News Media. What is true, is that as evidence comes out, they don’t write about it or bring it forward in any way, shape, or form.

Check out the recent story of 35,000 votes in the great State of Georgia, and watch what is happening in Arizona, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and other States.

They write whatever they want to write anyway without sources, fact-checking, or asking whether or not an event is true or false. Frankly, so many stories are made-up, or pure fiction. These writers are often bad people who write whatever comes to their mind or fits their agenda. It has nothing to do with facts or reality. So when reading the garbage that the Fake News Media puts out, please remember this and take everything with a “grain of salt.”"

Glenn has been an incredible success and will truly Make Virginia Great Again. Rarely have I seen such enthusiasm. Virginia has so much potential but has been badly hurt by awful economic policy, terrible crime, and the worst education system promoting Critical Race Theory, etc. But, Glenn will fix this immediately. He is a highly respected person, not just a figurehead like Virginia’s current and recent past Governors. Terry McAuliffe was a failed and unpopular Governor, whose only claim to fame was his relationship with Crooked Hillary Clinton—how did that work out? I knew McAuliffe well. He accepted large campaign contributions from me, said only great things and would do whatever I wanted, until I ran for office. He was a political HACK! If Virginia wants to open up and take advantage of its great and virtually unprecedented opportunity, Glenn Youngkin is the very successful businessman that will get them there!"

Instead of denouncing the rioters, he denounced himself—a humiliation for our Military. A year later even the Fake News had to admit that their Lafayette Square narrative was a giant lie.

After hundreds of subpoenas, over 3 million pages of documents, 4 years of searching, dozens and dozens of interviews, and millions of dollars of taxpayer funds wasted, they continue to be “in search of a crime” and will do anything to frighten people into making up the stories or lies that they want, but have been totally unable to get. In an unprecedented move, they retained an outside “Never Trumper” lawyer from a Trump-hating law firm to work on the case. It is a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt of all time. Now they are issuing ultimatums, working in close conjunction with the Washington, D.C. hacks who have been investigating me from the day I came down the escalator in Trump Tower, but who have failed. In fact, the guilty parties were these prosecutors’ partners in crime, the Radical Left Democrats and friends. They will do anything to stop the MAGA movement (and me), even if it involves prosecutorial misconduct and harassment of a political opponent, which they are using at levels rarely seen before. They leak, they lie, and they campaign based on information that has already been gone through in other of the many investigations I have put up with.  Now they just leaked that we were given one day, today, to make our case about things that are standard practice throughout the U.S. business community, and in no way a crime. They also know that no matter how strong our case, they will work hard to embarrass us and the Republican Party.  Having politically motivated prosecutors, people who actually got elected because they will “get Donald Trump,” is a very dangerous thing for our Country. In the end, people will not stand for it. Remember, if they can do this to me, they can do it to anyone! Why would anyone bring their company to New York, or even stay in New York, knowing these Radical Left Democrats would willingly target their company if viewed as a political opponent? It is devastating for New York! These Witch Hunters are relentlessly seeking to destroy a reputation of a President who has done a great job for this Country, including tax and regulation cuts, Border control, rebuilding the Military, and developing the vaccine in record time—thereby saving our Country, and far beyond. Washington, D.C. and ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court, should finally stop these vicious, angry, and highly partisan prosecutors. They are a disgrace to our Nation!"

Even the scam that took place in Georgia of ballot stuffing on camera, he couldn’t see what was wrong with it. Just like he failed to understand the Horowitz report and let everyone down with respect to getting a timely investigation (where’s Durham?) on all of the corruption of the Obama-Biden Administration.  It’s people in authority like Bill Barr that allow the crazed Radical Left to succeed. He and other RINOs in the Republican Party are being used in order to try to convince people that the election was legitimate when so many incredible facts have now come out to show conclusively that it wasn’t. He came in with a semi-bang and went out with a whimper. Earlier in his term Bill Barr went ballistic on CNN with Wolf Blitzer warning Democrats were changing election rules to flood the system with mail-in ballots that “as a matter of logic” are “very open to fraud.” They are, and Bill Barr did nothing about it. If there was no fraud, why are Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and other States spending so much time and effort on exposing the fraud? We already know that: 101,789 “obsolete” voters on the rolls in Georgia, including 18,486 dead peopleBallot batches off by up to 17.5 percent in Maricopa County, Arizona“Massive” chain of custody problems with drop boxes in Georgia, missing hundreds of thousands of records for months after the electionThousands of ballots “wheeled in through the back door” in Fulton County days after the election“Double feeding” ballots in Fulton County, GeorgiaNearly 200,000 illegal “indefinitely confined” votes in Wisconsin that violated Voter ID law“Cash for votes” scheme in NevadaIllegal alien votesElection law changes were not authorized by the State Legislatures, which is mandated by the U.S. Constitution And much more! If he felt this way, why did Barr say he was “greatly honored” and “proud to have played a role in the many successes and unprecedented achievements you have delivered for the American people” in the final letter he wrote to me? He said, “Few could have weathered these attacks, much less forge ahead with a positive program for the country."" Now it was revealed that Barr was being pushed to tell lies about the election by Mitch McConnell, another beauty, who was worried about damaging the Republicans chances in the Georgia runoff. What really damaged the Senate Republicans was allowing their races to be rigged and stolen, and worse, the American people to no longer believe their vote matters because spineless RINOs like Bill Barr and Mitch McConnell did nothing.  Bill Barr was a disappointment in every sense of the word. Besides which, Barr, who was Attorney General (lawyer) shouldn't be speaking about the President. Instead of doing his job, he did the opposite and told people within the Justice Department not to investigate the election. Just like he did with the Mueller report and the cover up of Crooked Hillary and RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA, they don’t want to investigate the real facts. Bill Barr’s weakness helped facilitate the cover up of the Crime of the Century, the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!"

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america-06.24.21,"Michigan State Senators Mike Shirkey and Ed McBroom are doing everything possible to stop Voter Audits in order to hide the truth about November 3rd. The Senate “investigation” of the election is a cover up, and a method of getting out of a Forensic Audit for the examination of the Presidential contest.  Corrupt (?) politicians falsely claim there was no Voter Fraud in Michigan (has anyone looked at what is considered the most corrupt election city in the U.S., DETROIT?), however, they admit to “problems with the numbers” that rigged 7,048 votes to illegally give a very conservative county to Joe Biden, which raised big signals, only to then find that it was actually President Trump that won the county by 3,788 votes, not Biden. The report mentions that Detroit engaged in “illegal actions” by blocking our poll workers, and concludes mailing of unsolicited ballot applications “demonstrates a clear vulnerability for fraud”, and then goes on to say that no one should question this election? Instead of doing a Forensic Audit, they want to investigate the Patriots who have fought for the truth and who are exposing a very possibly Rigged Election. The truth will come out and RINO’s will pay at the polls, especially with primary voters and expected challenges. Our Country was based on Free and Fair Elections, and that’s what we must have! Call those two Senators now and get them to do the right thing, or vote them the hell out of office! Contact: Sen. Mike Shirkey: (517) 373-5932 Contact: Sen. Ed McBroom: (517) 373-7840"

All Biden had to do is leave it the way it was, by far the strongest Southern Border our Country has ever had. Millions of people will now be streaming into our Country unchecked, unvetted, and unknown. Other countries are emptying their prisons with their worst criminals flowing into our Country. Drugs, gangs, and fugitives are pouring in every day. Hospitals, schools, communities, and police are overwhelmed. This is far more than a crisis—our Country is being destroyed!"

It’s an unmitigated disaster zone.  We went from detain-and-remove to catch-and-release. We went from having border security that was the envy of the world to a lawless border that is now pitied around the world. Biden and Harris have handed control of our border over to cartels, criminals, and coyotes. Drug dealers, MS-13 gang members, human smugglers, sex traffickers, and the criminal elements of the world now have free reign. Hospitals and schools are getting crushed and public health is being sacrificed all in service of a radical left anti-borders agenda. Our brave border agents and courageous ICE officers have been illegally stopped from doing their jobs. Our Nation is now one giant sanctuary city where even dangerous criminals are being cut loose and set free inside the U.S interior on a daily basis. If this weren’t bad enough, Biden and Harris won’t even tour the scenes of the wreckage they created, or come down and visit with the Border Patrol and ICE heroes risking their lives to defend our Nation at a time when the White House is doing everything it can to make their job totally impossible.  What Biden and Harris have done, and are continuing to do on our border, is a grave and willful dereliction of duty. My visit will hopefully shine a spotlight on these crimes against our Nation—and show the incredible people of ICE and Border Patrol that they have our unshakeable support. Media credentialing information will be provided at a later date."

Whether it be voting machines, underaged people, dead people, illegal aliens, ballot drops, ballot cheating, absentee ballots, post office delivery (or lack thereof!), lock boxes, people being paid to vote, or other things, the 2020 Presidential Election is, in my mind, the Crime of the Century. Just look at what has happened to our Country, our Borders, our Economy, Inflation, and more in the last five months, and it will only get worse. If there is going to be honor and greatness for America, the voting irregularities and fraud of that election must be brought to light, immediately. Otherwise, we have no Country, certainly not a great one! This should not be an attempt by the Biden Administration to suppress the accountability of a dishonest election. That cannot be allowed to happen, nor can the events of the Presidential Election. They want to cancel anything having to do with the result of that election because they know what was done. States cannot allow that to happen and should not be intimidated or suppressed by a government that wants nothing further to do with what took place during that period of time.

For instance, I closed our Borders to China very early despite his not wanting them closed. The Democrats and the Fake News Media even called me a “xenophobe.” In the end, we saw this was a life-saving decision, and likewise with closing our borders to Europe, specifically to certain heavily infected countries. I was later given credit, even by “Tony,” for saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Dr. Fauci also didn’t put an emphasis on speed of vaccine production because he thought it would take 3, 4, or maybe even 5 years to create. I got it done in less than 9 months with Operation Warp Speed. In retrospect, the vaccine is saving the world. Then, I placed the greatest bet in history. We ordered billions of dollars’ worth of vaccines before we knew it even worked. Had that not been done, our wonderful vaccines would not have been administered until October of this year. No one would’ve had the shot that has now saved the world and millions of lives! Also, Dr. Fauci was totally against masks when even I thought they would at least be helpful. He then changed his mind completely and became a radical masker! There are a lot of questions that must be answered by Dr. Fauci. The funding of Wuhan by the U.S. was foolishly started by the Obama Administration in 2014 but ended under the Trump Administration. When I heard about it, I said “no way.” What did Dr. Fauci know about “gain of function” research, and when did he know it?"

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america-05.19.21-2,"I have just learned, through leaks in the mainstream media, that after being under investigation from the time I came down the escalator 5 ½ years ago, including the fake Russia Russia Russia Hoax, the 2 year, $48M, No Collusion Mueller Witch Hunt, Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, and others, that the Democrat New York Attorney General has “informed” my organization that their “investigation” is no longer just a civil matter but also potentially a “criminal” investigation working with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. There is nothing more corrupt than an investigation that is in desperate search of a crime. But, make no mistake, that is exactly what is happening here.   The Attorney General of New York literally campaigned on prosecuting Donald Trump even before she knew anything about me. She said that if elected, she would use her office to look into “every aspect” of my real estate dealings. She swore that she would “definitely sue” me. She boasted on video that she would be, and I quote, “a real pain in the ass.” She declared, “just wait until I’m in the Attorney General’s office,” and, ”I’ve got my eyes on Trump Tower.” She also promised that, if elected, she would “join with law enforcement and other Attorney Generals across this nation in removing this President from office,” and, “It’s important that everyone understand that the days of Donald Trump are coming to an end.” The Attorney General made each of these statements, not after having had an opportunity to actually look at the facts, but BEFORE she was even elected, BEFORE she had seen even a shred of evidence.  This is something that happens in failed third world countries, not the United States. If you can run for a prosecutor’s office pledging to take out your enemies, and be elected to that job by partisan voters who wish to enact political retribution, then we are no longer a free constitutional democracy. Likewise, the District Attorney’s office has been going after me for years based on a lying, discredited low life, who was not listened to or given credibility by other prosecutorial offices, and sentenced to 3 years in prison for lying and other events unrelated to me. These investigations have also been going on for years with members and associates of the Trump Organization being viciously attacked, harassed, and threatened, in order to say anything bad about the 45th President of the United States. This would include having to make up false stories. Numerous documents, all prepared by large and prestigious law and accounting firms, have been examined, and many hours of testimony have been taken from many people, some of whom I have not seen in years. These Democrat offices are consumed with this political and partisan Witch Hunt at a time when crime is up big in New York City, shootings are up 97%, murders are up 45%, a rate not seen in 40 years, drugs and criminals are pouring into our Country in record numbers from our now unprotected Southern Border, and people are fleeing New York for other much safer locations to live. But the District Attorney and Attorney General are possessed, at an unprecedented level, with destroying the political fortunes of President Donald J. Trump and the almost 75 million people who voted for him, by far the highest number ever received by a sitting President. That is what these investigations are all about—a continuation of the greatest political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States. Working in conjunction with Washington, these Democrats want to silence and cancel millions of voters because they don’t want “Trump” to run again. As people are being killed on the sidewalks of New York at an unprecedented rate, as drugs and crime of all kinds are flowing through New York City at record levels, with absolutely nothing being done about it, all they care about is taking down Trump.   Our movement, which started with the Great Election Win of 2016, is perhaps the biggest and most powerful in the history of our Country. But the Democrats want to cancel the Make America Great Again movement, not by Making America First, but by Making America Last. No President has been treated the way I have. With all of the crime and corruption you read about with others, nothing happens, they only go after Donald Trump.   After prosecutorial efforts the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, they failed to stop me in Washington, so they turned it over to New York to do their dirty work. This is what I have been going through for years. It’s a very sad and dangerous tale for our Country, but it is what it is, and we will overcome together. I have built a great company, employed thousands of people, and all I do is get unfairly attacked and abused by a corrupt political system. It would be so wonderful if the effort used against President Donald J. Trump, who lowered taxes and regulations, rebuilt our military, took care of our Veterans, created Space Force, fixed our border, produced our vaccine in record-setting time (years ahead of what was anticipated), and made our Country great and respected again, and so much more, would be focused on the ever more dangerous sidewalks and streets of New York.   If these prosecutors focused on real issues, crime would be obliterated, and New York would be great and free again!"

New polling by CBS News on the state of the Republican Party (which is very strong!). “President Trump has a strong hold on the GOP.” 80% of Republicans agree with the removal of Liz Cheney from GOP Leadership and only 20% disagree. The poll also showed that 67% of Republicans said that they do not consider Sleepy Joe Biden to be the legitimate winner of the 2020 Presidential Election. I agree with them 100%, just look at the facts and the data—there is no way he won the 2020 Presidential Election! "

This is illegal and the Arizona State Senate, who is leading the Forensic Audit, is up in arms. Additionally, seals were broken on the boxes that hold the votes, ballots are missing, and worse. Mark Brnovich, the Attorney General of Arizona, will now be forced to look into this unbelievable Election crime. Many Radical Left Democrats and weak Republicans are very worried about the fact that this has been exposed. The DELETION of an entire Database and critical Election files of Maricopa County is unprecedented. Many other States to follow. The Mainstream Media and Radical Left Democrats want to stay as far away as possible from the Presidential Election Fraud, which should be one of the biggest stories of our time. Fox News is afraid to cover it—there is rarely a mention. Likewise, Newsmax has been virtually silent on this subject because they are intimidated by threats of lawsuits. One America News (OAN), one of the fastest growing networks on television, and the “hottest”, is doing a magnificent job of exposing the massive fraud that took place. The story is only getting bigger and at some point it will be impossible for the weak and/or corrupt media not to cover. Thank you to OAN and other brave American Patriots. It is all happening quickly!"

This was done purposely. The polls were a joke. I won States in a landslide that I was predicted to lose days before the election. Other states had me purposely so far down that it would force people, even fans, to say “Let's stay home Darling. We love our President, but he can’t win.” And then I would win those states or at least come very close. In one state that I actually won, but the results were rigged, ABC and the Washington Post had me down by 17 points. Even the rigged final result was extremely close. It’s called SUPPRESSION POLLING and it should be illegal. These are crooked, disgusting, and very dishonest media outlets and they know exactly what they are doing. The 2020 Presidential Election was, by far, the greatest Election Fraud in the history of our Country. The good news is, the American people get it and the truth is rapidly coming out! Had Mike Pence had the courage to send the Electoral College vote back to states for recertification, and had Mitch McConnell fought for us instead of being the weak and pathetic leader he is, we would right now have a Republican President who would be VETOING the horrific Socialistic Bills that are rapidly going through Congress, including Open Borders, High Taxes, Massive Regulations, and so much else!  "

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america-4.23.2021,"So many people would like to thank the brave and patriotic Republican State Senators from Arizona for the incredible job they are doing in exposing the large scale Voter Fraud which took place in the 2020 Presidential Election. Their tireless efforts have led to a massive recount, ballot examination, and full forensic audit, undertaken by experts retained by the State Senate, with results to be announced within six weeks. The Democrats, upon hearing the news of the Court Order, have sent 73 lawyers to Arizona in an effort to stop this recount and full transparency because THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID! The Democrats are desperate for the FRAUD to remain concealed because, when revealed, the Great States of Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, New Hampshire, and the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, would be forced to complete the work already started. The Arizona recount and examination will be on live TV (OAN) for all to watch. Why are the Democrats so desperate to stop this Election Fraud from being revealed? That answer is obvious! The Governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has been shockingly of zero help to the State Senate. He wants to “pretend” the election was free and fair. What are he and the Maricopa County Commissioners trying to hide? Our country needs the truth of the scam 2020 Election to be exposed. If it is not, just as if we have “no borders,” we cannot be a Great Nation. Honest elections are America’s Heart and Soul. We must never allow this to happen to our Great Country again. Thank you State Senators and others in Arizona for commencing this full forensic audit. I predict the results will be startling! "
2021-04-20,"Statement from Highly Respected Pollster, John McLaughlin",/news/statement-from-highly-respected-pollster-john-mclaughlin,"“President Trump is the strongest endorsement I have ever witnessed in politics. Polling continually shows that when President Trump endorses, it almost always clears the field and puts his America First candidate on the path to victory. That’s why everybody is coming to Mar-a-Lago for his support. Nationally, polling continually shows that 69% of all Republican primary voters want President Trump to run again in 2024—including 76% of Trump voters and 70% of Republicans. If President Trump runs again, Republican primary voters will support him 82% to 15%—including 89% among Trump voters and 83% among Republicans. John Bolton’s failed warmonger views are completely out of touch with today’s Republican Party and the majority of Americans. President Trump’s successful America First policies kept us safe. This is a big reason why Republicans want him to run again.”"

The FDA, especially with long time bureaucrats within, has to be controlled.  They should not be able to do such damage for possibly political reasons, or maybe because their friends at Pfizer have suggested it.  They’ll do things like this to make themselves look important.  Remember, it was the FDA working with Pfizer, who announced the vaccine approval two days after the 2020 Presidential Election.  They didn’t like me very much because I pushed them extremely hard.  But if I didn’t, you wouldn’t have a vaccine for 3-5 years, or maybe not at all.  It takes them years to act!  Do your testing, clean up the record, and get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine back online quickly.  The only way we defeat the China Virus is with our great vaccines!"

With leaders like Mitch McConnell, they are helpless to fight.  He didn’t fight for the Presidency, and he won’t fight for the Court.  If and when this happens, I hope the Justices remember the day they didn’t have courage to do what they should have done for America.  "

The Election on the other hand, was massively rigged and stolen—and now look what is happening to our Country, and in particular at our southern border.   If you are one of the record-setting 75 million Americans who voted for me, donated or volunteered, THANK YOU!

Wow.” Breitbart’s Alex Marlow: “The Washington Post just admitted to publishing fabricated quotes that suggested Trump was attempting a coup.

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America ",/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america_6,"The Washington Post just issued a correction as to the contents of the incorrectly reported phone call I had with respect to voter fraud in the Great State of Georgia.  While I appreciate the Washington Post’s correction, which immediately makes the Georgia Witch Hunt a non-story, the original story was a Hoax, right from the very beginning.  I would further appreciate a strong investigation into Fulton County, Georgia, and the Stacey Abrams political machine which, I believe, would totally change the course of the presidential election in Georgia. Fulton County has not been properly audited for vote or signature verification.  They only looked at areas of the State where there most likely would be few problems, and even there they found large numbers of mistakes.  We are seeking to find and reveal the large-scale election fraud which took place in Georgia.  Many residents agree, and their anger caused them not to turn out and vote for two Republican Senators in the January election. The Consent Decree signed between Raffensperger and Stacey Abrams was not approved by the Georgia State Legislature, and therefore should be deemed invalid, and the election result changed.  Why the Governor and Raffensperger ever approved this Consent Decree is one of the great questions?  We look forward to an answer. You will notice that establishment media errors, omissions, mistakes, and outright lies always slant one way—against me and against Republicans.  Meanwhile, stories that hurt Democrats or undermine their narratives are buried, ignored, or delayed until they can do the least harm—for example, after an election is over.  Look no further than the negative coverage of the vaccine that preceded the election and the overdue celebration of the vaccine once the election had concluded.  A strong democracy requires a fair and honest press.  This latest media travesty underscores that legacy media outlets should be regarded as political entities—not journalistic enterprises.  In any event, I thank the Washington Post for the correction."

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America ",/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america_2,"Karl Rove has been losing for years, except for himself. He’s a RINO of the highest order, who came to the Oval Office lobbying for 5G for him and a group. After a lengthy discussion with Rove and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, I said no, they’re not qualified. Our Nation can do much better! On Election Evening, Nov. 3rd, at 10:30pm, Rove called to congratulate me on “a great win.” I said thank you Karl, only to watch the rigged election take its final form. Karl Rove’s voice on Fox is always negative for those who know how to win. He certainly hasn’t helped Fox in the ratings department, has he?  Never had much of a feeling for Karl, in that I disagreed with so many of the things he says. He’s a pompous fool with bad advice and always has an agenda. He ran the campaign for two Senators in Georgia, and did a rotten job with bad ads and concepts. Should have been an easy win, but he and his friend Mitch blew it with their $600 vs. $2,000 proposal. Karl would be much more at home at the disastrous Lincoln Project. I heard they have numerous openings! If the Republican Party is going to be successful, they’re going to have to stop dealing with the likes of Karl Rove and just let him float away, or retire, like Liddle’ Bob Corker, Jeff “Flakey” Flake, and others like Toomey of Pennsylvania, who will soon follow. Let’s see what happens to Liz Cheney of Wyoming.  If it weren’t for me, the House would have lost 25 seats instead of gaining 15—it was a shock to everyone, and almost cost Pelosi her Speaker position. Likewise, 8-10 Senators would have lost their position, including Karl’s friend Mitch, our wonderful leader who would rather spend his time fighting me than Pelosi, Schumer, and Sleepy Joe. In last year’s Congressional primaries, 120 of the 122 candidates I endorsed won - and the two that lost were beaten by people claiming to be more Trump than their opponent. In the Senate, I was undefeated in primary endorsements with a record of 21 and 0, and close to that in the general election. 31 million people listened to my CPAC speech online, and it had among the largest television audience of the week, even though it was on cable at 4pm on Sunday afternoon. Karl Rove is all talk and no action! Next time Karl, save your Election night phone call and keep doing a great job for the Democrats. Fox should get rid of Karl Rove and his ridiculous “whiteboard” as soon as possible!"
2021-03-04,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America ",/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america_1,"The Wall Street Journal editorial page continues, knowingly, to fight for globalist policies such as bad trade deals, open borders, and endless wars that favor other countries and sell out our great American workers, and they fight for RINOS that have so badly hurt the Republican Party. That's where they are and that's where they will always be. Fortunately, nobody cares much about The Wall Street Journal editorial anymore. They have lost great credibility. To set the record straight, there were two reasons the Senate races were lost in Georgia. First, Republicans did not turn out to vote because they were so angry and disappointed with Georgia Republican leadership and Governor Kemp for failing to stand up to Stacey Abrams and the disastrous Consent Decree that virtually eliminated signature verification requirements across the state (and much worse), and was not approved by the State Legislature as required by the Constitution—having a major impact on the result, a rigged election. Second, Senator Mitch McConnell’s refusal to go above $600 per person on the stimulus check payments when the two Democrat opponents were touting $2,000 per person in ad after ad. This latter point was used against our Senators and the $2,000 will be approved anyway by the Democrats who bought the Georgia election—and McConnell let them do it! Even more stupidly, the National Republican Senatorial Committee spent millions of dollars on ineffective TV ads starring Mitch McConnell, the most unpopular politician in the country, who only won in Kentucky because President Trump endorsed him. He would have lost badly without this endorsement. "

2021-02-16,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America ",/news/statement-by-donald-j-trump-45th-president-of-the-united-states-of-america,"The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political “leaders” like Sen. Mitch McConnell at its helm. McConnell’s dedication to business as usual, status quo policies, together with his lack of political insight, wisdom, skill, and personality, has rapidly driven him from Majority Leader to Minority Leader, and it will only get worse. The Democrats and Chuck Schumer play McConnell like a fiddle—they’ve never had it so good—and they want to keep it that way! We know our America First agenda is a winner, not McConnell’s Beltway First agenda or Biden’s America Last. In 2020, I received the most votes of any sitting President in history, almost 75,000,000. Every incumbent House Republican won for the first time in decades, and we flipped 15 seats, almost costing Nancy Pelosi her job. Republicans won majorities in at least 59 of the 98 partisan legislative chambers, and the Democrats failed to flip a single legislative chamber from red to blue. And in “Mitch’s Senate,” over the last two election cycles, I single-handedly saved at least 12 Senate seats, more than eight in the 2020 cycle alone—and then came the Georgia disaster, where we should have won both U.S. Senate seats, but McConnell matched the Democrat offer of $2,000 stimulus checks with $600. How does that work? It became the Democrats’ principal advertisement, and a big winner for them it was. McConnell then put himself, one of the most unpopular politicians in the United States, into the advertisements. Many Republicans in Georgia voted Democrat, or just didn’t vote, because of their anguish at their inept Governor, Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and the Republican Party, for not doing its job on Election Integrity during the 2020 Presidential race. It was a complete election disaster in Georgia, and certain other swing states. McConnell did nothing, and will never do what needs to be done in order to secure a fair and just electoral system into the future. He doesn’t have what it takes, never did, and never will. My only regret is that McConnell “begged” for my strong support and endorsement before the great people of Kentucky in the 2020 election, and I gave it to him. He went from one point down to 20 points up, and won. How quickly he forgets. Without my endorsement, McConnell would have lost, and lost badly. Now, his numbers are lower than ever before, he is destroying the Republican side of the Senate, and in so doing, seriously hurting our Country. Likewise, McConnell has no credibility on China because of his family’s substantial Chinese business holdings. He does nothing on this tremendous economic and military threat.   Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack, and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again. He will never do what needs to be done, or what is right for our Country. Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First. We want brilliant, strong, thoughtful, and compassionate leadership.  Prior to the pandemic, we produced the greatest economy and jobs numbers in the history of our Country, and likewise, our economic recovery after Covid was the best in the world. We cut taxes and regulations, rebuilt our military, took care of our Vets, became energy independent, built the wall and stopped the massive inflow of illegals into our Country, and so much more. And now, illegals are pouring in, pipelines are being stopped, taxes will be going up, and we will no longer be energy independent. This is a big moment for our country, and we cannot let it pass by using third rate “leaders” to dictate our future! "
2021-01-28,President Donald J. Trump Meeting Readout ,/news/president-donald-j-trump-meeting-readout,"The meeting between President Donald J. Trump and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, was a very good and cordial one. They discussed many topics, number one of which was taking back the House in 2022. President Trump’s popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time. President Trump has agreed to work with Leader McCarthy on helping the Republican Party to become a majority in the House. They worked very well together in the last election and picked up at least 15 seats when most predicted it would be the opposite. They will do so again, and the work has already started."
