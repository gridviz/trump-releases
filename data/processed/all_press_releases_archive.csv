2022-04-21,Endorsement of Congressman Mike Carey,/news/news-w7fukyaa5a0,"Congressman Mike Carey is doing a fantastic job representing the people of Ohio’s 15th Congressional District. With my endorsement, Mike resoundingly won his special election last year. True to his campaign promises, Mike has been a courageous fighter for Ohio and our Economy. He is Strong on the Border, Tough on Crime, Defends the Second Amendment, and as a Veteran, he is actively working to support our Brave Military and Vets. Mike Carey has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
2022-04-21,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-3ekevtjtn60,"Congratulations to CNN+ on their decision to immediately FOLD for a lack of ratings, or viewers in any way, shape, or form. It was like an empty desert out there despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars and the hiring of low-rated Chris Wallace, a man who tried so hard to be his father, Mike, but lacked the talent and whatever else is necessary to be a star. In any event, it’s just one more piece of CNN and Fake News that we don’t have to bother with anymore!"
2022-04-21,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-2tbbhnrp8g0,"The Governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, and Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, perhaps in collusion with the Radical Left Democrats, have allowed a horrible thing to happen to a very popular Republican, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. She is now going through hell in their attempt to unseat her, just more of an election mess in Georgia, including the fact that they will still allow easily corruptible Ballot Boxes for all to cheat with, and have not been able to get a little thing called “Signature Verification” approved. Unlike other Republicans, this Governor does everything possible to hurt the voting process in Georgia, including his approval of a disastrous Consent Decree, and not calling a Special Session that was requested by Georgia’s Republicans Senators. He absolutely refused. Both of those failures were a disaster for the Republican Party, and for our Country. Even the “True the Vote” people, great patriots, who will soon announce massive Ballot Harvesting in Georgia and other States, said Kemp was the worst of all Governors to deal with—he didn’t want to do anything to help with finding this massive Ballot Harvesting fraud. Brian Kemp should be voted out of office—vote for David Perdue. REMEMBER, Brian Kemp will never be able to win the General Election against Stacey “The Hoax” Abrams because a large number of Republicans just will not vote for him."
2022-04-21,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-kacb8zevvh0,"If I did what Piers Morgan did in his fake interview with me, rigging and redoing my words, and then making it sound like I walked out of an interview, the failed gubernatorial candidate and Radical Left Racist, Attorney General of New York State, Letitia James, would start an immediate investigation and demand the re-institution of the death penalty, or whatever may be worse than that. Piers got caught red-handed, and the interview that I rather enjoyed doing is now in shambles. I especially enjoyed talking about the 2020 Presidential Election Fraud and his big mistake on the way he walked off his show when the “weatherman” made him look like a fool. I never walked out of my interviews with him, he’s easy, but he tried to make it look like I did. Unlike others, I don’t believe Piers is a complete slimeball, but he lost a lot of credibility. Interestingly, many of the Fake News Media outlets are covering his mistake. They view it as potentially fraudulent, and so do I. Piers is off to a bad start, but thanks to me, he may get a final burst of big ratings before it all comes crashing down!"
2022-04-21,Endorsement of Congressman Bill Johnson,/news/news-ymqryh3tmq0,"Congressman Bill Johnson is a fantastic Representative of the people of Ohio’s 6th Congressional District. A 26-year U.S. Air Force veteran and a respected leader in Ohio, Bill is fighting to Support our Military and Vets, Defend our Second Amendment, Secure the Southern Border, Promote American Energy Independence and Protect the Coal, Oil, and Gas Jobs that come with it. Bill Johnson was an early supporter of our MAGA movement, and he has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
2022-04-21,Endorsement of Congressman Brad Wenstrup,/news/news-scese84qa80,"Congressman Brad Wenstrup is doing a terrific job for the wonderful people of Ohio’s 2nd Congressional District! A physician and co-chairman of the Republican Doctors’ Caucus, Brad is working hard to Lower Health Care Costs and provide our Seniors with the Care they deserve. Brad is also a Colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, and is a strong supporter of our Military, Vets, Law Enforcement, Small Business and the Second Amendment. Brad Wenstrup has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
2022-04-20,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-uptx2brfh61903,"Piers Morgan, like the rest of the Fake News Media, attempted to unlawfully and deceptively edit his long and tedious interview with me. He wanted to make it look like I walked out on the interview when my time limit of 20 minutes went over by an hour. The good news is that the interview was taped by us as a means of keeping him honest. The interview was actually very strong on the 2020 Election Fraud, with me calling him “a fool” if he truly believed those results. The evidence is massive and irrefutable (check out Truth the Vote and the Dinesh D'Souza documentary, which will all be coming out soon). For those who want to make Piers look bad, compare his video promo and how it was doctored to the real thing. Hopefully they will now be doing some big changes to their final product. It just shows, however, what I have to deal with in the Fake News Media. He went out of his way to deceptively edit an interview and got caught. That is a big story, isn’t it? Listen to the audio here. "
