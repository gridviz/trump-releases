2022-08-25,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-jdj9sasdws2397,"Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats have just orchestrated another election enhancing money grab, this time to the tune of $300,000,000,000—and just like I predicted, it’s coming right out of the pocket of the working-class Americans who are struggling the most! Crippling inflation, unaffordable energy prices, and WAR—all things that should never have happened. But if that wasn’t enough, now Americans are bailing out College Administrators who fleeced students, and those who opted for Degrees there was no way they could afford. America is a nation in decline, and the cliff into oblivion is within sight. Stop voting for Democrats! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
2022-08-24,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-jvpkwzsj4m2398,"Thank you to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) for successfully suing to release the now infamous Mueller Memo on yet another Trump prosecution. In the nine-page memo it was revealed that, “Nothing would warrant a prosecution for obstruction of justice.” It underscored that “Mueller had not found sufficient evidence to charge any underlying crime,” and that the President “reasonably believed that the Special Counsel’s investigation was interfering with his governing agenda.” The memo concluded that “the evidence was insufficient to support a criminal charge—even if Trump were not president.” It was stated that my “conduct primarily reflected a frustration with the Mueller probe and what [I] perceived to be the politics behind it,” in addition to what I believed were absolutely flawed and Fake News reports. Sound familiar? CREW is devastated by these findings, that they worked so hard to “expose,” but may now move on to the even more ridiculous Witch Hunt that has already caused a great Mar-a-Lago Red Wave with the voters of our Nation! Read the full article from Breitbart here. "
2022-08-24,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-ymszhbkwj22399,"The Democrats have Mitch McConnell and his lovely wife, Elaine “Coco” Chao, over a barrel. He and she will never be prosecuted, as per the last paragraphs of this story, as long as he continues to give the Radical Left the Trillions and Trillions of Dollars that they constantly DEMAND. He was afraid to use the “Debt Ceiling Card” in order to stop the most expensive waste of money in our Country’s history, to be spent on the Green New Deal, which will only cause one thing, a Depression. These expenditures are something our Country can never recover from. Mitch McConnell is not an Opposition Leader, he is a pawn for the Democrats to get whatever they want. He is afraid of them, and will not do what has to be done. A new Republican Leader in the Senate should be picked immediately! Read the full article from the Federalist here. "
