2022-08-25,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-jdj9sasdws2397,"Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats have just orchestrated another election enhancing money grab, this time to the tune of $300,000,000,000—and just like I predicted, it’s coming right out of the pocket of the working-class Americans who are struggling the most! Crippling inflation, unaffordable energy prices, and WAR—all things that should never have happened. But if that wasn’t enough, now Americans are bailing out College Administrators who fleeced students, and those who opted for Degrees there was no way they could afford. America is a nation in decline, and the cliff into oblivion is within sight. Stop voting for Democrats! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
2022-08-24,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-jvpkwzsj4m2398,"Thank you to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) for successfully suing to release the now infamous Mueller Memo on yet another Trump prosecution. In the nine-page memo it was revealed that, “Nothing would warrant a prosecution for obstruction of justice.” It underscored that “Mueller had not found sufficient evidence to charge any underlying crime,” and that the President “reasonably believed that the Special Counsel’s investigation was interfering with his governing agenda.” The memo concluded that “the evidence was insufficient to support a criminal charge—even if Trump were not president.” It was stated that my “conduct primarily reflected a frustration with the Mueller probe and what [I] perceived to be the politics behind it,” in addition to what I believed were absolutely flawed and Fake News reports. Sound familiar? CREW is devastated by these findings, that they worked so hard to “expose,” but may now move on to the even more ridiculous Witch Hunt that has already caused a great Mar-a-Lago Red Wave with the voters of our Nation! Read the full article from Breitbart here. "

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-ymszhbkwj22399,"The Democrats have Mitch McConnell and his lovely wife, Elaine “Coco” Chao, over a barrel. He and she will never be prosecuted, as per the last paragraphs of this story, as long as he continues to give the Radical Left the Trillions and Trillions of Dollars that they constantly DEMAND. He was afraid to use the “Debt Ceiling Card” in order to stop the most expensive waste of money in our Country’s history, to be spent on the Green New Deal, which will only cause one thing, a Depression. These expenditures are something our Country can never recover from. Mitch McConnell is not an Opposition Leader, he is a pawn for the Democrats to get whatever they want. He is afraid of them, and will not do what has to be done. A new Republican Leader in the Senate should be picked immediately! Read the full article from the Federalist here. "

Read a first-hand account of what unfolded behind the scenes of the West Wing—the real story—and how some of our greatest accomplishments came to fruition over 4 hard-fought years. I am extremely proud of everything we accomplished in the White House—energy independence, the largest tax and regulation cuts in history, rebuilding our military, taking proper care of our Vets, Space Force, no inflation, and so much more.

Since then, I have checked and found him to be an outstanding person. In fact, he was named Michigan’s most Conservative legislator, and is strongly committed to Election Integrity. The MAGA movement should support the ticket! This is who Tudor wants and therefore, Shane is who I want as your next Lieutenant Governor. The Radical Left Democrats and Fake News Media demand that Republicans be divided. We must work together to defeat them and, in particular, Gretchen Whitmer! Tudor and Shane are committed to securing Michigan’s elections, fighting against the radical indoctrination of our children, saving the 2nd amendment, being tough on crime and working to bring JOBS back to Michigan (that are badly needed after the horrible term of the current liberal Democrat governor!). All Republicans must unite and work hard for Tudor and Shane. Also, never forget about our great Attorney General candidate, Matt DePerno, and wonderful Kristina Karamo, for Secretary of State! The MAGA movement in Michigan is stronger than ever, and we must make Michigan Trump Red in November. Always remember, AMERICA FIRST!"

2022-08-22,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America, Re: Break-In of Mar-a-Lago",/news/news-z95sbv3dvm0,"We have just filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida strongly asserting my rights, including under the Fourth Amendment of our Constitution, regarding the unnecessary, unwarranted, and unAmerican Break-In by dozens of FBI agents, and others, of my home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida. They demanded that the security cameras be turned off, a request we rightfully denied. They prevented my attorneys from observing what was being taken in the raid, saying “absolutely not.” They took documents covered by attorney-client and executive privilege, which is not allowed. They took my passports. They even brought a “safe cracker” and successfully broke into my personal safe, which revealed…nothing! We are now demanding that the Department of “Justice” be instructed to immediately STOP the review of documents illegally seized from my home. ALL documents have been previously declassified. We are demanding the appointment of a SPECIAL MASTER to oversee the handling of the materials taken in the raid. We are further demanding that the DOJ be forced to turn over a REAL, without “plants,” inventory of my property that was taken and disclose where that property is now located. We are demanding that all items wrongfully taken from my home be IMMEDIATELY returned. The wrongful, overbroad warrant was signed by a Magistrate Judge who recused himself just two months ago, from a MAJOR civil suit that I filed, because of his bias and animus toward me. This Mar-a-Lago Break-In, Search, and Seizure was illegal and unconstitutional, and we are taking all actions necessary to get the documents back, which we would have given to them without the necessity of the despicable raid of my home, so that I can give them to the National Archives until they are required for the future Donald J. Trump Presidential Library and Museum. I will never stop fighting for the American people, our Country, and the Rule of Law. Make America Great Again!"
