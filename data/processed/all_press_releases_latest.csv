2022-07-09,Endorsement of Congressman Markwayne Mullin,/news/news-gqmtwbph5h0,"Congressman Markwayne Mullin is running to represent the Great State of Oklahoma in the United States Senate.  I won Oklahoma twice, by record margins, and Markwayne will be doing the same thing for many years to come! An accomplished businessman and former undefeated professional MMA fighter, Markwayne has a consistent record of success that he’ll bring to the Senate. He is working hard to Secure the Border, Restore American Energy Independence (which we had just 16 months ago!), Fight Inflation, Protect Life, Defend the Second Amendment, and Reject the Radical Left’s Agenda that is destroying our Country. Markwayne has also seen the abuse that has taken place with the January 6th Unselect Committee, and the unfair treatment given to many people that went “peacefully and patriotically” to the Capitol, and now are being treated unfairly and with disdain. He understands this subject better than almost anybody. Many of these Americans are being held captive, while nothing happens to “the other side.” Markwayne Mullin is an America First Warrior, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

2022-07-07,Endorsement of Robert Scantlebury,/news/news-z5tdszmsrs2231,"Rob Scantlebury is a retired Police Sergeant running for State Senate in Arizona Legislative District 9. He has spent decades protecting the citizens of Arizona, and now wants to protect them in the State Legislature from the out of control Radical Left Democrats, and the almost as bad RINOs, who are standing by while they watch our Country being destroyed. MAGA Strong Rob Scantlebury won’t let that happen, and is running to protect Life, our First Amendment, Religious Liberty, our 2nd Amendment (which is under siege), to secure our Border, and to bring Great Education back to Arizona. His opponent, Tyler Pace, is a RINO like Jeff “Flakey” Flake (if that’s even possible!), who never had a clue. Robert “gets it,” and will always put America First. Early Voting is now underway, and Election Day is August 2nd. Get out and Vote for Robert Scantlebury, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
2022-07-07,Endorsement of Janae Shamp,/news/news-hgp7unkgjq2232,"Janae Shamp, who was spurred to action by the Rigged and Stolen 2020 Presidential Election, is running for the Arizona State Senate. Janae is not a politician—she’s a registered nurse, a Patriot, and MAGA through and through. Janae will defeat the RINOs and the Radical Left, will fight to restore our Border, which was the strongest ever and is now the weakest ever, make our schools great again, will stop unconstitutional mandates, and will always put America, and Arizona, FIRST. Her opponent, Joanne Osborne, is a RINO disaster, who is being pushed by pathetic Arizona governor, Doug Ducey, who has allowed so many bad things to happen to the State, like Weak Borders and bad Election Integrity. Even the sad clown, Jeff “Flakey” Flake, is on her side, and that’s all you have to know. Early Voting starts today, and Election Day is August 2nd. Vote for Janae Shamp in Arizona State Senate District 29. She will not let you down, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

2022-07-05,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-b9mdprsfmf2219,"Believe it or not, it is looking more and more like the United States is getting ready to remove the Tariffs on China. This would be a terrible mistake. These Tariffs have brought many Billions of Dollars to our Country, and made affected businesses, such as steel, viable again in the United States. Doing this would be the greatest gift that China could ever receive. Our Farmers alone got $28 billion as a gift from me, that came directly out of the Tariffs because of the way they were abused by China. Taking these Tariffs off would be a clear signal that the United States is weak, ineffective, and doing BUSINESS AS USUAL. Certain Senators are fighting hard to get this done, even saying such ridiculous things as it “causes inflation.” Those Senators should be questioned as to their real motives!"
