2022-08-08,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-gf6pdxrpau2342,"These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents. Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections. Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before. They even broke into my safe! What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee? Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States. The political persecution of President Donald J. Trump has been going on for years, with the now fully debunked Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, and so much more, it just never ends. It is political targeting at the highest level! Hillary Clinton was allowed to delete and acid wash 33,000 E-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable. She even took antique furniture, and other items from the White House. I stood up to America’s bureaucratic corruption, I restored power to the people, and truly delivered for our Country, like we have never seen before. The establishment hated it. Now, as they watch my endorsed candidates win big victories, and see my dominance in all polls, they are trying to stop me, and the Republican Party, once more. The lawlessness, political persecution, and Witch Hunt must be exposed and stopped. I will continue to fight for the Great American People!"

2022-08-04,Endorsement of Leora Levy,/news/news-gfqvaqtwe72335,"Leora Levy is running to represent the Great State of Connecticut in the United States Senate.  The current Senator is a mocked and laughed at fool, who said for many years that he was a brave war hero in Vietnam, when the facts later revealed that he had never even been to Vietnam.  Blumenthal stated, over and over again, that he had watched men die by his side as he fought in battle, talked and bragged about it incessantly, and yet it was all a total hoax and “con job,” and he should no longer be rewarded for the horrible fairytale that he has spun.  “Da Nang” Dick acts so sanctimonious and righteous when in actuality he is a coward who has gotten away with this disgusting crime against our Military for years.  He was ready to quit after being found out, tears rolling down his face, but he didn’t have the courage to leave the race in disgrace with the Election only a few days away.  Shockingly, not enough people heard about his fake war story, and he “won.”  He’s been in the Senate ever since with people rolling their eyes every time they see him in D.C.  It's finally time for him to pay the price of what he did, and be terminated as your United States Senator. Leora Levy, on the other hand, has done a fantastic job in life.  She has served on the Republican National Committee, and is a tireless advocate for Connecticut and for Conservative Values.  In the Senate, she will work hard to Grow the Economy, Secure the Border, Fight for Energy Independence, Support our Military and our Vets, champion Election Integrity, Protect the Second Amendment, and Fight Violent and Vicious Crime, which is at the highest level in Connecticut history. Her opponent, Themis Klarides, has been endorsed by 3 of the Worst RINOs in the Country, Larry Hogan, whose candidate the other night lost big, Charlie Baker, who couldn’t come close to getting the Republican Nomination in Massachusetts (thank you, President Trump!), and quit, and, of course, “Sloppy” Chris Christie, who left with the lowest approval rating of any Governor in the history of the State of New Jersey, and whose recent book set a record for the least sales ever per television interview. Ms. Klarides is Weak on Crime, Weak on our Military and Vets, and Will Not Be Protecting our under siege Second Amendment.  She has accused America of “systemic racism” and, very importantly, she has no chance of beating Da Nang Dick despite his fake and fraudulent military career. Leora Levy is a wonderful woman who works hard and smart, and will never let you down.  She will defeat the corrupt Richard Blumenthal in November, and what a victory that will be.  Leora has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
