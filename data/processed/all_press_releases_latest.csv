2022-07-12,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-5cdeyhffkd0,"The failing New York Times is down 40% year-to-date because they are Fake News. Their reporters are dishonest, and their front page has become a work of total fiction, not news. They hate our Country, and they hate reporting the truth, which is why America is not respected and our Nation has never been weaker. Instead, they obsess over January 6, just like they did over Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, the Mueller Witch Hunt, and Russia, Russia, Russia. The New York Times will continue to decline because people no longer believe their reporting is even close to being true. Fake polls, phony stories, and made up quotes—they are a disgrace to journalism and have set it back many many years. THE NEW YORK TIMES IS TRULY THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"
2022-07-12,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-zqnrf7p3nm0,"Dan Cox is doing a great job running for Governor of Maryland. He will bring dignity back to a State that is much more “red” than anyone would ever know or believe. Dan will fight for our schools, our jobs, and our entire way of life. More importantly, Dan will end Larry Hogan’s terrible RINO reign by defeating his “Never Trump” successor, another low-energy RINO, Kelly Schulz. Early Voting is underway and Election Day is July 19. Dan will do an amazing job restoring FREEDOM to a shutdown Maryland. Hogan is one of the worst in the Country, governed more like a Democrat than a Republican, cheated with South Korea on the Covid tests, and locked everything up with really bad results. Dan Cox is a terrific guy with a beautiful family. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

2022-07-09,Endorsement of Congressman Markwayne Mullin,/news/news-xjnqyevbzp2235,"Congressman Markwayne Mullin is running to represent the Great State of Oklahoma in the United States Senate.  I won Oklahoma twice, by record margins, and Markwayne will be doing the same thing for many years to come! An accomplished businessman and former undefeated professional MMA fighter, Markwayne has a consistent record of success that he’ll bring to the Senate. He is working hard to Secure the Border, Restore American Energy Independence (which we had just 16 months ago!), Fight Inflation, Protect Life, Defend the Second Amendment, and Reject the Radical Left’s Agenda that is destroying our Country. Markwayne has also seen the abuse that has taken place with the January 6th Unselect Committee, and the unfair treatment given to many people that went “peacefully and patriotically” to the Capitol, and now are being treated unfairly and with disdain. He understands this subject better than almost anybody. Many of these Americans are being held captive, while nothing happens to “the other side.” Markwayne Mullin is an America First Warrior, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

2022-07-07,Endorsement of Robert Scantlebury,/news/news-kc5n7dgrgv2231,"Rob Scantlebury is a retired Police Sergeant running for State Senate in Arizona Legislative District 9. He has spent decades protecting the citizens of Arizona, and now wants to protect them in the State Legislature from the out of control Radical Left Democrats, and the almost as bad RINOs, who are standing by while they watch our Country being destroyed. MAGA Strong Rob Scantlebury won’t let that happen, and is running to protect Life, our First Amendment, Religious Liberty, our 2nd Amendment (which is under siege), to secure our Border, and to bring Great Education back to Arizona. His opponent, Tyler Pace, is a RINO like Jeff “Flakey” Flake (if that’s even possible!), who never had a clue. Robert “gets it,” and will always put America First.

Janae is not a politician—she’s a registered nurse, a Patriot, and MAGA through and through. Janae will defeat the RINOs and the Radical Left, will fight to restore our Border, which was the strongest ever and is now the weakest ever, make our schools great again, will stop unconstitutional mandates, and will always put America, and Arizona, FIRST. Her opponent, Joanne Osborne, is a RINO disaster, who is being pushed by pathetic Arizona governor, Doug Ducey, who has allowed so many bad things to happen to the State, like Weak Borders and bad Election Integrity. Even the sad clown, Jeff “Flakey” Flake, is on her side, and that’s all you have to know. Early Voting starts today, and Election Day is August 2nd. Vote for Janae Shamp in Arizona State Senate District 29. She will not let you down, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
