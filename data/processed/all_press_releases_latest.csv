2022-06-30,ICYMI: President Trump Responds: Unselect Committee Testimony is ‘Absolutely Crazy’,/news/news-pbtxppxfev0,
2022-06-29,Endorsement of David Farnsworth,/news/news-hkwx6kxxwy0,"David Farnsworth is an outstanding individual who has shown great courage in representing the wonderful people of Arizona! He has fought tirelessly on the 2020 Presidential Election Fraud Scandal, the open and poisonous Southern Border, for our totally under siege Second Amendment, our Military, our Vets, Tax and Regulation Cuts, and so many other things important to the people of the State that he so loves, and is a True Patriot, and has risked it all for his love of our Country and its Constitution. David Farnsworth is going against a longtime political operative, or hack, Rusty Bowers, who has been an absolute disaster for Arizona and everything which Arizona Values represent. Bowers fought Election Integrity harder than any Democrat, or even the RINO Commissioners of Maricopa County. In fact, the RINOs of the State, headed by Bowers and his group, were far worse than the Democrats because you never knew where they were coming from. Bowers must be defeated, and highly respected David Farnsworth is the man to do it. He will straighten things out and secure your Border (just as we had, when I was President, the most secure Southern Border in the history of our Country, only two short years ago!). This is a very important race because it will determine the future of Arizona, which is now on the precipice of disaster, with illegal aliens pouring in at every level and voters, through massive voter fraud and irregularities, losing their VOICE. David Farnsworth will get rid of the stench of Rusty Bowers and his crew of RINOs who are systematically destroying everything that Arizona stands for. He is a puppet of Governor Doug Ducey, a man who was totally afraid to act on so many important issues. It is my great honor to state that former State Senator David Farnsworth has my Complete and Total Endorsement for State Senate in Arizona Legislative District 10!"
2022-06-29,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-vvw4ccmert0,"A very strong Bill by great State Senator Doug Mastriano (hopefully the next Governor of the Commonwealth) just passed in the Pennsylvania House and Senate, The Poll Watcher Empowerment Act, which will bring transparency back to the election process and make sure there is no counting in back rooms, such as in Philadelphia, where they cheat, cheat, cheat! This, and other Election Integrity measures like banning drop boxes, no private funding, Voter ID, and same day voting with paper ballots, should be tied to the State Budget. Republicans must get tough and smart if they want to win (easily) Pennsylvania! "

2022-06-26,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-r5kbsw7tfz2176,"I listen to all of these foolish (stupid!) people, often living in a bygone era, like the weak and frail RINO, Peggy Noonan, who did much less for Ronald Reagan than she claims, and who actually said bad things about him and his ability to speak, or Rich Lowry, who has destroyed the once wonderful and influential National Review, the pride and joy of the legendary William F. Buckley, or George Will, whose mind is decaying with hatred and envy before our very eyes, or Jonah Goldberg and Stephen Hayes, two people who are finally out of the conversation and of no relevance whatsoever. Where do these people come from? They have no idea what the MAGA movement is, and even less of an understanding of America First, which is necessary, and even vital, to save our Country. People like these are nasty, jealous, not smart, and of no use to the potential greatness of our Country. They talk, they criticize, and they complain, but they don’t have the ability or talent to get anything done. They are shortsighted “losers”, and will never understand what it takes to Make America Great Again!"
