2022-09-27,Endorsement of Sandy Smith,/news/news-2aacgeekab2510,"Sandy Smith will be a fantastic Representative from the Great State of North Carolina's 1st Congressional District. I love North Carolina! A successful business owner and proud military mother, Sandy will Strengthen our Military, Fight for our Vets, Promote School Choice, Defend our under siege Second Amendment, and Support our Country’s Great Farmers and Manufacturers. Importantly, she knows what to do against ever-spiraling Inflation—and she will do it. Her opponent, Don Davis, is a Radical Left puppet of Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. He believes in Open and Unchecked Borders, and doesn’t mind the fact that other Countries are dumping their prisoners into the United States of America. Davis refuses to fight the Out-of-Control Crime in our Cities, and strongly believes in Defunding our Police. He voted against the Parents’ Bill of Rights Act and is against, believe it or not, Voter ID. Don Davis is a disaster for North Carolina and all that its Great People stand for! Sandy Smith, on the other hand, will be a tremendous and proud Representative of the 1st Congressional District. She will never let you down and, for that reason, Sandy Smith has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
2022-09-27,Endorsement of Senator James Lankford,/news/news-zmees3asf42511,"Senator James Lankford ran a strong Campaign against highly credible opponents who fought hard but, ultimately, were unsuccessful. James was strongly committed to America First, and everything it stood for, and likewise strongly committed to me, as President. Sometimes we didn’t exactly agree on everything, but we do now. He is a very good man with a fabulous wife and family, loves the great State of Oklahoma, and is working very hard on trying to Save our Country from the disaster that it is in. Interestingly, I won Oklahoma—77 of 77 Counties both times—so I have a serious obligation to do things right! James Lankford is Strong on the Border, Tough on Crime, and Very Smart on the Economy. He is fighting to Stop Inflation, Defend our under siege Second Amendment, and Restore American Energy Independence, just as we had it during the Trump Administration where we would soon be, in fact, Energy Dominant. Sadly, that went up in dust with the Biden Administration—but James will help us get it back. It is my great honor to give James Lankford my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
