Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-cgrmdanvud0,"A puppet judge of the New York Attorney General and other sworn enemies of President Trump and the Republican Party has just issued a ruling never before seen anywhere in America. It is Communism come to our shores. Businesses will be fleeing New York, which they already are, for other states and other countries. Today’s ridiculous ruling by a politically-motivated, hand-picked judge makes it even more vital for courts in both New York and Florida to do the right thing and stop this inquisition. We have to fight back against radical tyranny and save our Country!"

2022-11-03,Endorsement of Gerald Malloy,/news/news-28rbkgkmhx0,"It is a great honor to endorse an American Patriot who is running in what would normally be a difficult State for a Republican, but things are changing fast, and his Radical Left opponent, Peter Welch, is absolutely terrible—he does not represent the values of the Great People of Vermont. For the past 16 years, Welch has accomplished nothing in Congress except to boost his own Net Worth by Millions of Dollars. The people of Vermont deserve more than a self-serving political ""hack"" in the U.S. Senate. Vermont needs a Patriot—and that is Gerald Malloy! A Brave Veteran, Malloy knows how to fight to Protect our Country, Uphold the Constitution, and Restore the Rule of Law. As U.S. Senator, Malloy will work very hard to Reduce Crime, Stop Inflation, Secure our Border, Protect our under siege Second Amendment, and Restore American Energy Independence, and even Dominance. Gerald Malloy has my Complete and Total Endorsement—he will never let you down!"

2022-11-02,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-bugtu5jtce2745,"Today, I filed a lawsuit in Florida State Circuit Court against the corrupt Attorney General of New York State, Letitia “Peekaboo” James. New York State is one of the most crime-ridden places on earth with murders, robberies, drug deals, and every other form of crime setting records on a weekly basis. While James does nothing to protect New York against these violent crimes and criminals, she attacks great and upstanding businesses which have done nothing wrong, like the very successful, job and tax producing Trump Organization that I have painstakingly built over a long period of years. Crooked and highly partisan James now thinks it is the business of the State of New York to go after my revocable trust and pry into my private estate plan, only to look for ways to recklessly injure me, my family, my businesses, and my tens of millions of supporters. If I were not elected President of the United States, and now leading in the polls by substantial margins against both Democrats and Republicans, this would not be happening. We have to stand up for our Country, fight against illegal persecution, and Make America Great Again!   Read the lawsuit here."
