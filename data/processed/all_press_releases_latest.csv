2022-06-13,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-phadfpes7f0,"Our nation is SUFFERING. Our economy is in the gutter. Inflation is rampant. Gas prices have reached an all-time high. Ships are unable to unload cargo. Families cannot get needed baby formula. We are an embarrassment around the world. Our withdrawal from Afghanistan was a disaster that cost us precious American blood, and gave $85 billion worth of the best military equipment on earth to our enemy. Millions and millions of illegals are marching to the border and invading our country. We have a White House in shambles, with Democrats, just this week, declaring that Biden is unfit to run for reelection. And what is the Democrat Congress focused on? A Kangaroo Court, hoping to distract the American people from the great pain they are experiencing.  Seventeen months after the events of January 6th, Democrats are unable to offer solutions. They are desperate to change the narrative of a failing nation, without even making mention of the havoc and death caused by the Radical Left just months earlier. Make no mistake, they control the government. They own this disaster. They are hoping that these hearings will somehow alter their failing prospects. A certain Democrat once said, “It's the economy, stupid.” Well, Democrats now seem to think that Americans are “stupid.” They are not. America is crumbling, and Democrats have no solutions. Our nation has no hope of change for the better under Democrat leadership. People are desperate. Rather than solving problems, Democrats are rehashing history in hopes of changing the narrative. During my time in office, our nation was thriving, our economy was strong, and the price of gas was very low. Above all else, we were respected, perhaps like never before.  America prospered under the Trump Administration.   Continue reading here.  "

2022-06-10,Endorsement of Katie Britt,/news/news-x758nymtdm2129,"Last year I endorsed Mo Brooks for the U.S. Senate because I thought he was a Fighter, especially when it came to the Rigged and Stolen Presidential Election of 2020.  The evidence is irrefutable.  Then, out of nowhere, and for seemingly no reason, Mo backtracked and made a big mistake by going Woke at our massive Cullman, Alabama Rally.  Instead of denouncing the Voter Fraud in the Election, Mo lectured the crowd of 63,000 people saying, “Put that behind you, put that behind you,” meaning that, in effect, forget the Rigged Election and go on to the future.  The problem is, if you do that, it will happen again.  Also, why do Republicans allow Democrats to get away with rigging and stealing elections?  Mo was strongly booed by tens of thousands of Great Alabama Patriots for abandoning his constituents, and what they know to be true about the Election Fraud.  He foolishly started listening to the wrong consultants and not to the people, and his 54-point lead evaporated overnight.  Likewise, his words caused me to withdraw my Endorsement, and Mo has been wanting it back ever since—but I cannot give it to him! Katie Britt, on the other hand, is a fearless America First Warrior.  The opposition says Katie is close to Mitch McConnell, but actually, she is not—in fact, she believes that McConnell put Mike Durant in the race to stop her, which is very possibly true.  Katie is an Incredible Fighter for the people of Alabama.  As President and CEO of Alabama’s Business Council, Katie has been working hard to Grow Alabama’s Economy, Create Jobs, and Restore the Great American Dream.  She has the Total Support and Endorsement of Chairman Jimmy Parnell and the Alabama Farmers Federation. The proud mother of two wonderful children, Katie, along with her great husband, Wesley, a Star at the University of Alabama and the New England Patriots, are True Champions for the American Family.  Katie Strongly Supports our under siege Second Amendment, Stands Up for Parental Rights, and Will Fight for our Military, our Vets, and Election Integrity. Above all, Katie Britt will never let you down.  So Get Out and Vote for Katie Britt on June 21st in the Alabama Senate Runoff—she has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

2022-06-10,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-rm8h8xms2q2133,"Last week, on June 1, a three-judge panel of the Georgia Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in a vital case involving the public’s right to know the truth about the makeup of 148,000 absentee ballots, many of which were harvested and dumped into drop boxes in the dark of night in the period leading up to the November 3, 2020 election in Fulton County, Georgia. This case is being closely watched by millions of Georgia voters and American patriots all across the country who are demanding transparency! Petitioners who filed the case are Caroline Jeffords and Robbin Sotir, registered voters who argue that their votes were diminished and diluted, and who are supported by affidavits of eyewitnesses who observed that many absentee ballots were never folded (which is required in order to be mailed inside an envelope!), that other ballots were filled out with a printer rather than by a person using a pen (which is obviously corrupt and illegal), along with other disqualifying “irregularities.” Greatly respected Georgia attorney Bob Cheeley and his law firm are fighting on the side of the Petitioners and our Democracy, itself. The appeals court panel of Presiding Judge Christopher J. McFadden, Judge Elizabeth Gobeil and Judge Andrew A. Pinson, were asked by Mr. Cheeley to reverse the trial court which, after originally granting the Petitioners’ motion to unseal the ballots and permit an inspection of the absentee ballots and the envelopes, stated that there needs to be a one-to-one ratio of envelopes to ballots. Cheeley urged the appeals court to recognize that the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held, as far back as 1942, that if a citizen alleges that there is evidence of vote dilution due to “ballot stuffing,” then a “particularized injury” has been established and the courts have routinely allowed an inspection. He also made the key points that Georgia law allows a Superior Court judge to unseal ballots for inspection and that ballots are not protected under the state’s Open Records Act. Therefore, it is crystal clear that citizens of Georgia should be permitted to see the ballots and the envelopes that those ballots should have been inserted into prior to mailing or being placed into a drop box. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies should be very interested in the Jeffords/Sotir case, because the Federalist Society is founded on the principles that the state exists to preserve freedom, that the separation of governmental powers is central to our Constitution, and that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judiciary to say what the law is, not what it should be.  I join with millions of Georgians and implore these fine jurists to reverse the trial court and send the case back to the lower court which previously determined that Petitioners, through expert testimony, had established a strong case justifying the unsealing of Fulton’s absentee ballots from the November 2020 elections. Why don’t they want to show the ballots and the envelopes? What are they hiding? The very foundation of our Country is at stake and the people of Georgia, and our Nation, deserve to know the truth about who won the 2020 election!"
