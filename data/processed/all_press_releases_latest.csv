2022-08-22,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-k3224tpvd92389,"There is a fabulous new book out, Breaking History: A White House Memoir, by my Son-in-Law, Jared Kushner. Read a first-hand account of what unfolded behind the scenes of the West Wing—the real story—and how some of our greatest accomplishments came to fruition over 4 hard-fought years. I am extremely proud of everything we accomplished in the White House—energy independence, the largest tax and regulation cuts in history, rebuilding our military, taking proper care of our Vets, Space Force, no inflation, and so much more. Get this great book now!"
2022-08-22,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-f6txem29ca2390,"Tudor Dixon MUST defeat Gretchen Whitmer in November! I have talked to Tudor about the race and her choice of a running mate, Shane Hernandez. Since then, I have checked and found him to be an outstanding person. In fact, he was named Michigan’s most Conservative legislator, and is strongly committed to Election Integrity. The MAGA movement should support the ticket! This is who Tudor wants and therefore, Shane is who I want as your next Lieutenant Governor. The Radical Left Democrats and Fake News Media demand that Republicans be divided. We must work together to defeat them and, in particular, Gretchen Whitmer! Tudor and Shane are committed to securing Michigan’s elections, fighting against the radical indoctrination of our children, saving the 2nd amendment, being tough on crime and working to bring JOBS back to Michigan (that are badly needed after the horrible term of the current liberal Democrat governor!). All Republicans must unite and work hard for Tudor and Shane. Also, never forget about our great Attorney General candidate, Matt DePerno, and wonderful Kristina Karamo, for Secretary of State! The MAGA movement in Michigan is stronger than ever, and we must make Michigan Trump Red in November. Always remember, AMERICA FIRST!"

2022-08-22,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America, Re: Break-In of Mar-a-Lago",/news/news-z95sbv3dvm0,"We have just filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida strongly asserting my rights, including under the Fourth Amendment of our Constitution, regarding the unnecessary, unwarranted, and unAmerican Break-In by dozens of FBI agents, and others, of my home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida. They demanded that the security cameras be turned off, a request we rightfully denied. They prevented my attorneys from observing what was being taken in the raid, saying “absolutely not.” They took documents covered by attorney-client and executive privilege, which is not allowed. They took my passports. They even brought a “safe cracker” and successfully broke into my personal safe, which revealed…nothing! We are now demanding that the Department of “Justice” be instructed to immediately STOP the review of documents illegally seized from my home. ALL documents have been previously declassified. We are demanding the appointment of a SPECIAL MASTER to oversee the handling of the materials taken in the raid. We are further demanding that the DOJ be forced to turn over a REAL, without “plants,” inventory of my property that was taken and disclose where that property is now located. We are demanding that all items wrongfully taken from my home be IMMEDIATELY returned. The wrongful, overbroad warrant was signed by a Magistrate Judge who recused himself just two months ago, from a MAJOR civil suit that I filed, because of his bias and animus toward me. This Mar-a-Lago Break-In, Search, and Seizure was illegal and unconstitutional, and we are taking all actions necessary to get the documents back, which we would have given to them without the necessity of the despicable raid of my home, so that I can give them to the National Archives until they are required for the future Donald J. Trump Presidential Library and Museum. I will never stop fighting for the American people, our Country, and the Rule of Law. Make America Great Again!"
