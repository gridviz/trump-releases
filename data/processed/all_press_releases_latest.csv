This is not a time for him to hide, but a time to act! I don’t know his opponent in the upcoming Primary, but feel certain he will do well if Speaker Vos doesn’t move with gusto. Robin, don’t let the voters of Wisconsin down!"

2022-07-19,Endorsement of Congressman Tim Walberg,/news/news-6ew5afgewb2269,"Congressman Tim Walberg is a tireless advocate for the wonderful people of Michigan! Tim is fighting to Secure the Border, Hold Big Tech Accountable, and Restore American Energy Independence.  He is working hard to Deliver Education Solutions for our Children, Support our Military and Veterans, Defend the under siege Second Amendment, and Stop the Trafficking of Opioids into our Communities. Tim is a strong Crime Fighter who adores our Police. Tim Walberg puts “America First” and has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Michigan’s 5th Congressional District!"
2022-07-19,Endorsement of Mark Finchem,/news/news-nsz5ue4ar22270,"Arizona State Representative Mark Finchem is running for Secretary of State, and he is the kind of fighter we need to turn Arizona and our Country around. Mark is tough, strong, and he loves his State. His opponent, Michelle Ugenti-Rita, is a weak “Never Trumper” RINO, and friends with all the Radical Left Democrats. She doesn’t make a move without them, and their sole purpose is to stop Mark Finchem because they know he is the only candidate who will put an end to the Weak Border and Massive Voter Fraud. He will bring Integrity back to our Elections. Vote for Mark Finchem on August 2, he has my Complete and Total Endorsement—he will not let you down!"
2022-07-19,Endorsement of David Farnsworth,/news/news-ecm3urkyyx2271,"Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers is a weak and pathetic RINO who has blocked Election Integrity, allowed illegals to pour into Arizona, and betrayed the people of his Great State. Bowers knew we Won in 2020, but he didn’t have the “guts” to do anything about the Rigged and Stolen Election. He is now the “darling” of the D.C. Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs, who lie about everything, allow no due process, cross examination, or real Republican representation. Rusty Bowers is now running for the State Senate to continue his “con job” against the People of Arizona. He’s WEAK on Borders, Election Integrity, and everything else. The Voters won’t stand for it any longer! Primary Day is on August 2. Get Out and Vote for David Farnsworth, a wonderful man who will not rest until our Borders are Strong, and our Elections are totally Free and Fair Again. David Farnsworth has my Complete and Total Endorsement."
2022-07-18,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-8kadts9vtu2260,"The Pulitzer Board has taken away any shred of credibility it had left with its “response” regarding the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, which was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for blatant fake news. Instead of acting with integrity and providing transparency, the Pulitzer Board is running cover for the biggest reporting failure in modern history: the fake Russia Russia Russia collusion hoax.Why would The Washington Post or The New York Times ever want to admit their obvious mistakes and come clean when their false reporting is being guarded, and awarded, by the Pulitzer Prize, which at one point actually meant something?These outlets should hand back their prizes without notification from Pulitzer, which would be the honorable thing to do.The only way The New York Times and The Washington Post should get a possible Pulitzer Prize would be in a new category—disinformation, for helping to perpetrate a false story created and peddled by Crooked Hillary Clinton, the DNC, and certain lowlife Democrats.The truth is that the 2018 Pulitzer Prize was handed out for reporting that merely parroted political disinformation—disinformation that we know was fabricated by foreign operatives and my political opponents.If the Pulitzer Prize has become a blatant acknowledgement of false, liberal political propaganda, then the Pulitzer Board should just say so.Instead, they hide their supposed “independent investigations” in a veil of secrecy, so the public cannot know the truth.I will continue doing everything possible to right the wrong caused by the 2018 Pulitzer Prize and also to right the wrong being done by the January 6 Committee of Unselects, where there is no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, no real Republican members, and no legitimacy. It is a witch-hunt of the highest level, the likes of which has never been seen in our Country before."
