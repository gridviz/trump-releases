2022-09-07,Endorsement of Mike DeWine and Jon Husted for Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Ohio,/news/news-xbemba2hxe2448,"Things are really starting to look good in Ohio for Republicans, probably because they’ve seen the alternative, and the alternative is not good. I won Ohio twice, in a landslide, and we may have to do it again! With a heated Senate race where J.D. Vance is pulling ahead of a “RINO Democrat,” Tim Ryan, who has tied himself to me rather than Biden, yet he’s voted 100% for Biden’s destructive economic policies, little has been said about the race for Governor, where we have an outstanding person running, Mike DeWine, who quietly, but professionally and patriotically, goes about doing his job, and really well. Running alongside his very talented and loyal Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted, Ohio has been in strong hands with the Economy “roaring,” especially in the four years that I was President. This great team is running against a terrible person, and failed Mayor, Nan Whaley, where crime rates in Dayton, under her leadership, have reached new highs. I know very well who she is, and she would send Ohio back to the Stone Ages. Mike DeWine and Jon Husted truly deserve my Complete and Total Endorsement, AND THEY’VE GOT IT—they will never let you down!"

The level of love they have for our Country is both unbelievable and highly impressive—it is more than anyone would ever know. If the Radical Left Lunatics that work so hard to destroy our Country could just get a little bit of the love, energy, enthusiasm, spirit, and patriotism that we witnessed last night, our Country would go to the top of every list like a rocket ship. Thank you to everyone who attended the Rally last night. It was a two-hour speech, and the only disappointment was that they were screaming, “Please, please, go longer.” They love our Country, and I love them!"
