2022-06-02,Endorsement of Tim Michels,/news/news-j9jma9wybv0,"Tim Michels is a very successful businessman running for Governor of the Great State of Wisconsin. During my Administration, Tim served on my infrastructure task force, and helped us plan and start building the Keystone XL Pipeline before Joe Biden launched his assault on American Energy production. The current Governor, Tony Evers, has been an abject failure for the people of Wisconsin, from his abysmal handling of the China Virus, where his lockdowns were unprecedented, to rampant crime across the State. Wisconsin needs a Governor who will Stop Inflation, Uphold the Rule of Law, strengthen our Borders (we had the strongest borders in history just two years ago, now we have the weakest!) and End the well-documented Fraud in our Elections.  Tim Michels is the best candidate to deliver meaningful solutions to these problems, and he will produce jobs like no one else can even imagine.  Tim is an America First Conservative who Supports our Second Amendment, Honors our Brave Law Enforcement and First Responders, and Stands Strongly against the Woke Mob trying to destroy our Country. Tim Michels has my Complete and Total Endorsement.  If Wisconsin has the wisdom to make Tim their next governor, it will have unprecedented success!"
2022-06-02,Endorsement of Blake Masters,/news/news-jf7zjqkrsv0,"Blake Masters is one of the most successful businessmen and investors in the Country, having led a multibillion-dollar firm that invests in new technology and many other emerging companies. In addition, he runs a nonprofit foundation that promotes science and innovation.  In other words, he is a great modern-day thinker!  A graduate of Stanford University and Stanford University Law School, a fantastic student, Blake is also the author of The New York Times bestseller, “Zero to One.” Despite having such an amazing business career and wonderful family, Blake has decided that he wants to make a difference for the people of our Country, and is therefore running for the United States Senate from the Great State of Arizona. Blake is Strong on Border Security, in particular, the disastrous Southern Border where people are pouring into the U.S. by the millions, and destroying our Country.  Just two years ago, with the help of the Wall, we had the Strongest Border in the history of our Country, and now we have the weakest—Blake will turn that around quickly. Additionally, he will Cut Taxes and Regulations, be Tough on Crime, and Support our Military and our Vets.  Blake will fight for our totally under-siege Second Amendment, and WIN! Mark Brnovich is such a disappointment to me.  He is the current Arizona Attorney General, and while he understands what took place in the 2020 Presidential Election, and that it was Rigged and Stolen, he only views it as something he would like not to see happen again.  The Arizona State Senate gave him overwhelming evidence of fraud and irregularities, issued a report which was damning, and he did nothing about it.  In other words, all talk and no action!  As an example, hundreds of “mules” trafficked ballots in the 2020 Election in Arizona, and Brnovich has refused to hold them accountable.  The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors refused to comply with a lawful Arizona Senate subpoena, and Brnovich failed to use his authority to compel the County to turn the information over.  He didn’t want to make “waves.” Brnovich, therefore, does not support clean and fair elections, or law and order, and could not properly represent the people of Arizona in the United States Senate. Arizona is a State where the 2020 Election was Rigged and Stolen, and a very thorough audit proved it.  Blake knows that the “Crime of the Century” took place, he will expose it and also, never let it happen again. It is my great honor to give Blake Masters my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
