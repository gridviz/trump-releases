2022-07-26,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-63m6eswcj72300,"Incredible how The New York Times just never gives up. One of their third-rate columnists wrote a story on Saturday saying that, despite almost universal victories in every major race, Trump may be losing his power. The article, written by Ross Douthat, doesn’t cover “minor” events like the fact that on Tuesday, in the Great State of Maryland, Dan Cox, a person not known but strongly Endorsed by me, absolutely destroyed the Endorsed and highly campaigned for candidate of RINO Governor Larry Hogan. This was a big upset. Fox News said it couldn’t happen! Likewise, with my Endorsement, J.D. Vance came from low in the polls to the front of the pack in Ohio. Dr Oz was also losing substantially, but went up like a rocketship once he was Endorsed by me. Ted Budd went from 3% to almost 60%, beating a former Governor by a record amount. Blake Masters in Arizona, was in third place, but because I Endorsed him, he is now leading by big numbers. Likewise, Kari Lake was one of eight candidates, and now she is, perhaps by a wide margin, in first place. In Wisconsin, I Endorsed Tim Michels, a man not well known but extremely successful, and he is now strongly leading for Governor. In Texas, I was 33-0. Every single person I Endorsed won! Likewise, for most other candidates. PERFECT in 23 States so far, UNDEFEATED in all U.S. Senate Primaries (13-0). And now others, in Missouri and Michigan, are waiting for me to Endorse, one way or another. They say, whoever I endorse will win! There are far too many races to discuss on our Truth Social platform (which in my opinion is far better than Twitter), but just like The New York Times got a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax (only to since report that the story was a FAKE, it was a made up fairytale of zero truth or consequence), their story about my possible “weakening” power is Fake News, that doesn’t mention any of these recent Victories. P.S., The Times should give up its “manufactured” Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, which was the exact opposite of the facts. They got it all wrong. The only thing they should get a Pulitzer Prize for is writing Fake News. Likewise, The Washington Post! I will say that there are disadvantages to having this never before seen Endorsement power. I endorsed Mitch McConnell, who was going to lose in a record fashion, and he ended up winning. I endorsed Brian Kemp in Georgia, who was going to come in last place, and he won in a landslide. And I Endorsed some others who have not been good to me, but I will never be good to them either. The true story is that my Endorsements have been, by any standard, amazing—stronger than ever seen before in our Country’s history. If the opposite case were true, I would be fine with strong reporting on it, but as long as it’s not, report the News correctly and accurately. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
