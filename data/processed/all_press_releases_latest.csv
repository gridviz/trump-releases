2022-07-05,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-qgredmn4zh2219,"Believe it or not, it is looking more and more like the United States is getting ready to remove the Tariffs on China. This would be a terrible mistake. These Tariffs have brought many Billions of Dollars to our Country, and made affected businesses, such as steel, viable again in the United States. Doing this would be the greatest gift that China could ever receive. Our Farmers alone got $28 billion as a gift from me, that came directly out of the Tariffs because of the way they were abused by China. Taking these Tariffs off would be a clear signal that the United States is weak, ineffective, and doing BUSINESS AS USUAL. Certain Senators are fighting hard to get this done, even saying such ridiculous things as it “causes inflation.” Those Senators should be questioned as to their real motives!"

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-qax5prg2zb2208,"Hearing RINO Larry Hogan has tried to come to the rescue of his fellow “Never Trumper,” Kelly Schulz. They say the Democrats want to face Dan Cox in the general election, when the opposite is true. It is just more Democrat disinformation. They want weak RINO Schulz, who is endorsed by the Amazon Washington Post. The Schulz campaign is coming up with last minute smears because they know their candidate is losing, and losing big! Schulz even got a “tip” on what the Democrat Governor Association is doing (Collusion?). It’s all phony games. The last thing Radical Left Democrats want is a real fighter in Maryland, or any other great state, and that’s Dan Cox all the way. Dan is the MAGA candidate who will save Maryland from the lunatics trying to destroy our borders, destroy our economy, destroy our energy, and destroy our schools. Primary day is July 19th, vote for Dan Cox, and his fantastic running mate, Gordana Schifanelli, who both have my Complete and Total Endorsement. They will never let you down!"
