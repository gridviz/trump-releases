2022-08-02,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-ury3jdaeqz0,"Great spending time with my friend, Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary. We discussed many interesting topics—few people know as much about what is going on in the world today. We were also celebrating his great electoral victory in April. "
2022-08-02,Endorsement of Adam Steen,/news/news-agnxmmhgbb0,"Wisconsin’s 63rd Assembly District has a rising patriotic candidate named Adam Steen, who is running against the RINO Speaker of the Assembly, Robin Vos.  Although Vos claims to be a Republican, he is constantly fighting America First efforts and policies.  Our great slogan, Make America Great Again, is not exactly high on his list! Robin Vos supports substantially increasing Wisconsin’s gas tax, a terrible move that will seriously hurt the State’s residents.  He is also demanding the turning of Wisconsin’s public highways into toll roads as an easy, but painful, way of raising funds. As Speaker of the Assembly, Robin Vos consistently blocked efforts at conducting a full cyber forensic audit of the 2020 Election.  In fact, his appointee to study Election Fraud in Wisconsin, highly-respected Justice Michael Gableman, found massive Election-changing fraud, abuse, and irregularities.  Despite hearing this powerful evidence, Vos refused to do anything to right the wrongs that were done.  Vos let the big Supreme Court victory become just another story.  Interestingly, Justice Gableman has strongly endorsed Adam Steen.  Janel Brandtjen, the Chairwoman of the Wisconsin Assembly’s Election Committee, has also endorsed Steen, because Vos has blocked all of her efforts to secure the State’s Elections. “Rampant fraud and abuse occurred statewide,” stated Justice Gableman—yet Speaker Vos has taken no steps to hold the Wisconsin Election Commission accountable for endangering vulnerable nursing home residents in 2020.  Likewise, he has done nothing to clean up Wisconsin’s voter rolls, or remove Wisconsin from the highly controversial Election Registration Information Center (ERIC).  Vos strongly supports ballot-drop boxes, which were just declared illegal by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and tried to draft legislation to allow them, despite the outcry by his constituents.  The Democrats haven’t even bothered to put up a candidate to run against Vos because he does everything they say—he is their dream candidate—a Republican who does the job of a Democrat. Speaker Vos had 17 years to prove to Wisconsin residents that he has their best interest in mind, but even in his own campaign efforts, Vos has tried to mislead his constituents, sending out mailers that feature a picture he took with me—trying to make voters believe I am a Vos supporter, which I am not.  He does not come close to supporting America First policies, and I do not come close to supporting him. Adam Steen, on the other hand, is a motivated Patriot, dedicated to making Wisconsin Great Again.  He has had the courage to stand up strongly against “Speaker” Vos.  Adam will bravely serve the people of Wisconsin, and bring with him strength, wisdom, and a new patriotism.  Adam Steen has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-cqq2qbvst20,"The Unselect Committee of Political Thugs has not devoted one hour to the massive Election Fraud and Irregularities that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election, the reason that hundreds of thousands of people went to Washington on January 6th. When will they start? The Unselects also refuse to look at why Crazy Nancy Pelosi and the Mayor of D.C. turned down from 10-20,000 troops. Why is this, I wonder?"

2022-07-29,Endorsement of Tudor Dixon,/news/news-qy8tawjvub2314,"The Great State of Michigan is being destroyed by the Radical Left Democrats. Governor Gretchen Whitmer is the Queen of lockdowns (except for her husband), school closures, and a suffering economy that’s not just hurting Michigan, but the entire Country. It’s time for a BIG change, and a BIG comeback!  When I met Tudor Dixon, she was not well known, but I could tell she had something very special—it was a quality that few others have. She delivered a powerful speech on how she would lead Michigan, fight for Election Integrity, turn around the Economy, and protect the future of Michigan for every child. Then, after recognizing her during my Rally speech in April, her campaign took off like a rocket ship. The great people of Michigan got it—just like I did.  Tudor Dixon is a Conservative Warrior who built an impressive career in the steel industry while working with her fabulous father, who is now watching her proudly from above. She raised a beautiful family, and is ready to save Michigan. She’s pro-God, pro-Gun, and pro-Freedom, and she won’t be stopped! She will stand up to the Radical Left as they try to indoctrinate our children and is ready to take on one of the worst Governors in the nation, Gretchen Whitmer, who is trying to destroy Michigan and our Country. Tudor Dixon will make a great Governor and has my Complete and Total Endorsement. She will not let you down!"

2022-07-26,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-adjun8yjjv2300,"Incredible how The New York Times just never gives up. One of their third-rate columnists wrote a story on Saturday saying that, despite almost universal victories in every major race, Trump may be losing his power. The article, written by Ross Douthat, doesn’t cover “minor” events like the fact that on Tuesday, in the Great State of Maryland, Dan Cox, a person not known but strongly Endorsed by me, absolutely destroyed the Endorsed and highly campaigned for candidate of RINO Governor Larry Hogan. This was a big upset. Fox News said it couldn’t happen! Likewise, with my Endorsement, J.D. Vance came from low in the polls to the front of the pack in Ohio. Dr Oz was also losing substantially, but went up like a rocketship once he was Endorsed by me. Ted Budd went from 3% to almost 60%, beating a former Governor by a record amount. Blake Masters in Arizona, was in third place, but because I Endorsed him, he is now leading by big numbers. Likewise, Kari Lake was one of eight candidates, and now she is, perhaps by a wide margin, in first place. In Wisconsin, I Endorsed Tim Michels, a man not well known but extremely successful, and he is now strongly leading for Governor. In Texas, I was 33-0. Every single person I Endorsed won! Likewise, for most other candidates. PERFECT in 23 States so far, UNDEFEATED in all U.S. Senate Primaries (13-0). And now others, in Missouri and Michigan, are waiting for me to Endorse, one way or another. They say, whoever I endorse will win! There are far too many races to discuss on our Truth Social platform (which in my opinion is far better than Twitter), but just like The New York Times got a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax (only to since report that the story was a FAKE, it was a made up fairytale of zero truth or consequence), their story about my possible “weakening” power is Fake News, that doesn’t mention any of these recent Victories. P.S., The Times should give up its “manufactured” Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, which was the exact opposite of the facts. They got it all wrong. The only thing they should get a Pulitzer Prize for is writing Fake News. Likewise, The Washington Post! I will say that there are disadvantages to having this never before seen Endorsement power. I endorsed Mitch McConnell, who was going to lose in a record fashion, and he ended up winning. I endorsed Brian Kemp in Georgia, who was going to come in last place, and he won in a landslide. And I Endorsed some others who have not been good to me, but I will never be good to them either. The true story is that my Endorsements have been, by any standard, amazing—stronger than ever seen before in our Country’s history. If the opposite case were true, I would be fine with strong reporting on it, but as long as it’s not, report the News correctly and accurately. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
