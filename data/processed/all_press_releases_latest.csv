2022-07-01,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-qexmtbm2ch2208,"Hearing RINO Larry Hogan has tried to come to the rescue of his fellow “Never Trumper,” Kelly Schulz. They say the Democrats want to face Dan Cox in the general election, when the opposite is true. It is just more Democrat disinformation. They want weak RINO Schulz, who is endorsed by the Amazon Washington Post. The Schulz campaign is coming up with last minute smears because they know their candidate is losing, and losing big! Schulz even got a “tip” on what the Democrat Governor Association is doing (Collusion?). It’s all phony games. The last thing Radical Left Democrats want is a real fighter in Maryland, or any other great state, and that’s Dan Cox all the way. Dan is the MAGA candidate who will save Maryland from the lunatics trying to destroy our borders, destroy our economy, destroy our energy, and destroy our schools. Primary day is July 19th, vote for Dan Cox, and his fantastic running mate, Gordana Schifanelli, who both have my Complete and Total Endorsement. They will never let you down!"

2022-06-29,Endorsement of David Farnsworth,/news/news-gban2nbbfx2195,"David Farnsworth is an outstanding individual who has shown great courage in representing the wonderful people of Arizona! He has fought tirelessly on the 2020 Presidential Election Fraud Scandal, the open and poisonous Southern Border, for our totally under siege Second Amendment, our Military, our Vets, Tax and Regulation Cuts, and so many other things important to the people of the State that he so loves, and is a True Patriot, and has risked it all for his love of our Country and its Constitution. David Farnsworth is going against a longtime political operative, or hack, Rusty Bowers, who has been an absolute disaster for Arizona and everything which Arizona Values represent. Bowers fought Election Integrity harder than any Democrat, or even the RINO Commissioners of Maricopa County. In fact, the RINOs of the State, headed by Bowers and his group, were far worse than the Democrats because you never knew where they were coming from. Bowers must be defeated, and highly respected David Farnsworth is the man to do it. He will straighten things out and secure your Border (just as we had, when I was President, the most secure Southern Border in the history of our Country, only two short years ago!). This is a very important race because it will determine the future of Arizona, which is now on the precipice of disaster, with illegal aliens pouring in at every level and voters, through massive voter fraud and irregularities, losing their VOICE. David Farnsworth will get rid of the stench of Rusty Bowers and his crew of RINOs who are systematically destroying everything that Arizona stands for. He is a puppet of Governor Doug Ducey, a man who was totally afraid to act on so many important issues. It is my great honor to state that former State Senator David Farnsworth has my Complete and Total Endorsement for State Senate in Arizona Legislative District 10!"
2022-06-29,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-ethg3vxg7x2196,"A very strong Bill by great State Senator Doug Mastriano (hopefully the next Governor of the Commonwealth) just passed in the Pennsylvania House and Senate, The Poll Watcher Empowerment Act, which will bring transparency back to the election process and make sure there is no counting in back rooms, such as in Philadelphia, where they cheat, cheat, cheat! This, and other Election Integrity measures like banning drop boxes, no private funding, Voter ID, and same day voting with paper ballots, should be tied to the State Budget. Republicans must get tough and smart if they want to win (easily) Pennsylvania! "
