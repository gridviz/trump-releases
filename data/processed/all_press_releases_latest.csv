Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-2rjgkb4z2b2244,"Inflation just hit ANOTHER 40-year high of 9.1%, which is terrible for our Country. Fuel prices up 60%, Airfare up 34%, Eggs up 33%—how can people survive this? How can businesses survive this? Our Country is so weak right now because the Radical Left Democrats have no clue what they are doing. All they want to do is “get Trump,” and they are willing to destroy our Nation to do it. America will not allow this to go on for much longer. Don’t vote for the Radical Left Democrats, vote for America First Republicans—Save America!"
2022-07-12,"Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America",/news/news-vfwn3s4xay2238,"The failing New York Times is down 40% year-to-date because they are Fake News. Their reporters are dishonest, and their front page has become a work of total fiction, not news. They hate our Country, and they hate reporting the truth, which is why America is not respected and our Nation has never been weaker. Instead, they obsess over January 6, just like they did over Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, the Mueller Witch Hunt, and Russia, Russia, Russia. The New York Times will continue to decline because people no longer believe their reporting is even close to being true. Fake polls, phony stories, and made up quotes—they are a disgrace to journalism and have set it back many many years. THE NEW YORK TIMES IS TRULY THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"

He will bring dignity back to a State that is much more “red” than anyone would ever know or believe. Dan will fight for our schools, our jobs, and our entire way of life. More importantly, Dan will end Larry Hogan’s terrible RINO reign by defeating his “Never Trump” successor, another low-energy RINO, Kelly Schulz. Early Voting is underway and Election Day is July 19. Dan will do an amazing job restoring FREEDOM to a shutdown Maryland. Hogan is one of the worst in the Country, governed more like a Democrat than a Republican, cheated with South Korea on the Covid tests, and locked everything up with really bad results. Dan Cox is a terrific guy with a beautiful family. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

He understands this subject better than almost anybody. Many of these Americans are being held captive, while nothing happens to “the other side.” Markwayne Mullin is an America First Warrior, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"

He has spent decades protecting the citizens of Arizona, and now wants to protect them in the State Legislature from the out of control Radical Left Democrats, and the almost as bad RINOs, who are standing by while they watch our Country being destroyed. MAGA Strong Rob Scantlebury won’t let that happen, and is running to protect Life, our First Amendment, Religious Liberty, our 2nd Amendment (which is under siege), to secure our Border, and to bring Great Education back to Arizona. His opponent, Tyler Pace, is a RINO like Jeff “Flakey” Flake (if that’s even possible!), who never had a clue. Robert “gets it,” and will always put America First. Early Voting is now underway, and Election Day is August 2nd. Get out and Vote for Robert Scantlebury, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement!"
